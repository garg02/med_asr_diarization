well those are all the questions i had for you we will do a covid test today simply because your symptoms overlap with some of the symptoms of covid it is also possible that you just have a just the common cold and that would get better over time you might have caught something from your colleague who was sick last week so it is great that you have been instead of isolating yourself and staying away", "d from your wife i would also recommend if you have not already done so to not i know that the you have symptoms started yesterday evening but just to try to work from home or take some time

because you have some symptoms that overlap with it so you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results", "d but it does sound like what you are telling me with the wet cough and you know a little bit of shortness of breath i think it is worthwhile to get a chest x ray to see if you might possibly have a pneumonia and if you do if there is some consolidation we will probably prescribe some antibiotics for that umm how does that", "d sound to you p sounds great to me yeah i just you know hope there is nothing serious going on d yeah yeah and it should not be it is probably

stable and from there we will get a chest x ray and run some lab work to to try to help figure out the the diagnosis better but in the meantime we will", "d use some inhalers because it is possible that this is a copd exacerbation similar to last year and the inhalers should help open up the airways and dilate so make breathing easier and then also if it is a copd exacerbation it will likely require antibiotics as well as some steroids for the the inflammation for 5 days but since your symptoms", "d currently overlap with covid as well you will have to get a a covid nasal swab p okay okay

the hip so when she was born she she was getting like this clicking noise and her in her hips and so she was in this splint for probably almost 2 months at the start like after she was born d ok and", "d was she able to walk afterwards p yeah yeah and we were seeing a specialist an orthopedic surgeon and they were managing her and after one year they stopped following her she was well like she was

weakness when testing around the joint p no d no ok so i think that was everything that", "d i wanted to ask on history and check was there anything i maybe forgot about you thought would be more important today p no i think that is all just just was wondering what might be going on d yeah certainly so a couple of things that it could be one is that it can be common in this age group is something called transient synovitis", "d can happen in the hip where there is some inflammation and it causes some pain following a viral infection and it sounds like she had a viral infection last week with the cough fever and and runny nose and her she was feeling a bit warm and maybe feverish today as well which could be a sign with the lower kind of slightly elevated temperature", "d pointing towards transient synovitis which is a condition that will be self limiting and can use anti inflammatories to help with the pain such as ibuprofen but also something that would be important to rule out would be is septic arthritis because it could could lead to damage of the joint", "d but this will be lower on the differential and then finally something to consider is legg calve perthes disease and but this would be more of progressive onset but if she is not getting any better and or if she becomes more sick like develops a really high fever or a red", "d hot swollen joint then we would be thinking more along the lines of septic arthritis and we want to reassess p ok sounds good thank you so much", "d what brings you in p yeah so i am bringing in my year old son here with i because he is had a fever and and a cough and a runny nose these symptoms have been going on now for the last 2 days d last 2 days ok uhm all of these symptoms have been going on for the last 2 days

by movements also could be like injuries to some of that the ligaments there as well and however with this", "d swelling immobilization for the last 2 days as well as the pain kind of being a bit progressive that with swelling and a positive homan in test and your temperature is a little bit elevated today not quite a fever but feverish it does increase the suspicion for deep vein thrombosis and so", "d i think the most likely thing right now is actually a dvt or deep vein thrombosis and so we will order some diagnostic studies get an ultrasound of your right calf as well as an x ray of the right knee to to start ok p ok sounds good thank you so much", "d what brings you in p i brought my son in today because he had a fever that started 2 days ago and and then since then he he is had

ok ok yeah that is good to know", "d so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of covid we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms and it does not it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia so for that we", "d will get a chest x ray we will check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x ray shows consolidation umm or some sort of infiltrate it is likely that he has pneumonia so we will start by giving him some amoxicillin", "d or cefuroxime for 5 days and just keep monitoring his symptoms they should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete if his condition gets worse like he is getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures just take him to the er and if symptoms do not resolve in 5 to 7 days we can do further work up or things like fungal infections", "d or tb or things like that how

she has and how can we treat her d yeah so it seems like that the hoarseness of voice and the sore throat and her symptoms mostly align with what is called laryngitis and this is usually caused by like just a viral respiratory infection the", "d hoarseness of voice will usually last more than a week and up to like 10 days and it should resolve on its own but we will definitely take a better look and do a proper physical examination see if i see any kind of swelling redness or any like white streaks or exudates around her pharynx as well so after we take a look we will", "d seem like it can also be a bacterial infection in which case we would need to give her antibiotics but usually it is a viral infection that should go away on its own so we would just kind of wait and see and potentially just give her voice some rest during this period and just go on from there do you have any other questions", "d or concerns p no that sounds great thank you d you are welcome and yeah we

since you have had this cough for the last 2 weeks we definitely want to do a covid swab just in case you have been working from home but if there was any potential contact they usually it comes back in 24 to 48 hours p okay d other than that sometimes with a history of smoking you can have something called copd we can like after", "d the physical examinations and everything we can potentially discuss doing pulmonary function tests as well and yeah but other than that it can also just be like a dry cough can be just a viral upper respiratory tract infection that takes 2 or more weeks to

just have been feeling really hot so i was just concerned about that d yeah for sure and i think that is a valid concern so right now i am just going through you know a list of differential diagnoses that you could possibly have and covid it is definitely top on my list and so we will", "d likely get a swab and run those tests and try to get that back to you as soon as we can it could also be other respiratory infections especially viral infections this time of the year and so if it comes back negative for covid it is probably you know something else like respiratory virus or even the flu so we will go from there", "d and if it turns out it is not a viral infection we will likely see if it is some sort of bacterial infection in which we can prescribe antibiotics for those but it definitely sounds like there is an infectious picture going on here because of the acuteness of the presentation and just your symptoms so we will do afollow up in a week or so until then we will run", "d all these labs does that sound good p alright yeah that sounds good so i guess i will kind of self isolate until the covid results come back d 0 yes please do so that is that is a great point i do suggest isolating for 2 weeks at least if you have any sort", "d of symptoms because even though the pcr that we do to test for covid is supposed to be reliable and it is supposed to be specific and sensitive there are sometimes false negative tests you know just to be on the safe side if you are experiencing any of the symptoms that overlap with covid symptoms isolate for 2 weeks but by the end of the week we should", "d know what the test results are and then you will know for sure what you have p ok awesome thank you d yeah thank you", "d how may i help you p i just came in because i have been having this just just yesterday it started this sudden just pain over the front of my kind of like a shoulder an also elbow and it was right after doing i was just doing some workout and this pain just started and it is just like a stabbing sharp pain that has not", "p really gone away since then d ok and so what activity were you doing specifically p so i was doing so i was just doing weight training and i was kind of flexing my elbows and i was working on my biceps i was on that machine where you so know i was not using", "p weights or doing curls but i was working on my

heard a pop at that time p i am not sure if i heard a pop actually i think i might have though", "d ok and did the pain start immediately or or a bit later on p the pain i think it started pretty soon after like probably within like half an hour of that happening d ok and where is the pain located now p the pain", "p right now is a yeah just kind of right at the front of my right elbow as well as near my shoulder as well d ok and i think you mentioned the pain as as being sharp is that how you would describe the character of the pain p yeah it is sharp yeah i just feel like something stabbing in there", "d ok and does the pain radiate anywhere else p no it is kind of in the same area as they described d ok has there been anything you have tried to make the pain better p no nothings i tried like advil nothings really worked d ok and sorry how long is how many days is the pain been on going on for just just started yesterday p yesterday", "d and since then has the pain getting any better or any worse p i think it is the same probably a bit worse than so it just happened last evening and i i did not end up coming last night but i wanted to make sure i am just coming this morning since it is just been a really painful night d ok have you done anything that is made the pain worse since last night", "p tried to just rest and i tried to use some ice but nothing nothing has been working and i kind of also have like this it it is weird it is just like this mass right where my biceps is it kind of just makes my biceps look really big d ok alright well i skip look at that during the physical exam component thank you and so", "d there like swelling there is as well or is is that part painful p yeah it is painful there swelling there as well d ok and well how severe is the pain on a scale of 10 to one 10 being the worst pain that you have ever experienced and one being the least p probably at least an 8 maybe a", "d ok so the pain is pretty severe then it sounds like ok have you had any fevers or chills p no d have you had any unexpected weight loss p no d ok and have you had any appetite loss p uhm no d ok and have you had any headaches", "p no d how about any sensory changes like changes to vision or hearing p no nothing like that d any changes to your sense of smell or sense of taste p nope d have you had a runny nose or a sore throat p uhm no nothing like that d ok have you had a cough p no d any shortness of breath p no d ok", "d any wheezing p no d have you had any chest pain p no d have you had any heart palpitations or feeling like your heart is racing p

even blood in the stool p no nothing like that d ok any urination problems such as pain or frequency p nope d ok and have you noticed any changes to your skin like rashes or changes to your nails or hair p no d alright and have you had any neurological symptoms such as numbness or tingling p no i do not think so", "d ok and have you had any muscle weakness p just just in the in that area i can not really like i can not really flex an really move my upper upper arm in my elbow d ok do you have any pains in any other joints p no that is", "p only my right upper arm d ok and have you had any confusion or memory loss p no ok and in the past have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions p uhm no i have been pretty healthy i they think", "p i do have like pre diabetes but i am not on any medication d ok and have you had any issues with your shoulder before like like a subacromial like impingement syndrome or like a rotator cuff pains or problems in the past p a few years ago i did have some pain", "p with like some they they told me not to do like overhead work like just things that require like with physio i need to do some strengthening as well and it was it was not the same same shoulder d ok and do you take any medications regularly p no d ok and", "d do you have any allergies p no d have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries p i had my tonsils removed when i was probably like 10 or something but that is about it d ok and for the shoulder in the past did you have any imaging done like an ultrasound or or mri maybe to look at the structures p no it was just", "p it kind of went away i just did some physio they did not really do any imaging d i see ok and can you tell me a little about your living situation right now like you are living with and where p yeah so i am living with my wife and daughter and i am living just in a condominium", "p in the city d ok and are you working right now p yeah so i am an accountant i am working from home so it is not that bad but i i might just take a few days off depending on what i have to do with this injury d ok and do you and hobby wise you mentioned like weight lifting", "d are you an active person like bodybuilding and that sort of thing regularly p i i just actually probably started this past year i used to i used to workout a lot in university and in my early 30s but then i stopped and this year i have kind of gone back into it d ok well it is good that you are staying active", "d and do you smoke cigarettes p no i probably tried a couple times and high school and university but just it was never my thing d ok and how about cannabis like smoking marijuana or using any of those types of products p no i i try to stay away from any drugs", "d including recreational drugs p yeah d ok and are there any musculoskeletal or neurological problems that that run in the family p not that i know of no d ok now how about any autoimmune diseases p no i do not think so d ok so next i just", "d wanted to ask you to have a look at the at the arm compared to the other side are you noticing any swelling redness or p yeah any swelling or redness i do see some just like kind of like in the middle of this area some redness kind of looks like some bruising in in that in", "p also feel like when i like try to flex my biceps kind of have moved upwards d ok is this the mass or lump that i you were mentioning earlier that you kinda can notice in the in your right arm p yeah yeah d ok is there any temperature change like does it feel", "d warm on that side p uhm i can not really tell if it is warm or not d ok and you so you mentioned are you able to bend your elbow all the way up so to flex it all the way up or is a range of motion limited p it is pretty limited it is pretty tough to flex it is really", "p painful and that i also can not like i can not turn my arm i can not supinate d ok so yeah so is that so you have reduced supination as well p yeah d and how are your shoulder movement are you able to like if you are lifting your arms straight out in front of you are you able to to lift them all the way up above your head p out like at the", "p sides or in front of me d in front of you p yeah the shoulder seems to be ok i am able to lift up but it is just if i try to move my upper arms at all it hurts a lot d ok alright so you will get some pain at the at the shoulder with the movement", "p there is discomfort in the affected side but i can i can move it much more than i can move my elbows or anything like that d ok i see so i think that was everything that i wanted to ask about and and i look for on on the physical today was there anything i may be missed or anything like that p uhm no i think i do not have any other questions d ok", "d so based on the history and what you are telling me for the physical as well of having a history of exercising and also shoulder pain with overhead head movements which are risk factors for developing a biceps tendon tear or biceps tendon injury and having the swelling and bruising as well as reduced function of biceps or elbow", "d flexion they all suggests that there is a biceps tendon tear or injury there and so will want to get an ultrasound or mri to look at will start with the ultrasound but then possibly get an mri as well to look at the extent of the tissue damage but if there is just a long head of biceps tear it will usually be treated", "d conservatively and so we will just need to look to see what the extent of the injury is p ok", "d what brings you here today p hi yeah i have had the stuffy nose that has been on and off as well as a runny nose for the past week and it does not seem to be getting any better so i thought i should come in and get it checked out in

questions for me p i yeah how do i get rid of this and it is really been bugging me d yeah it kind of so just a stuffy nose in the runny nose it seems like it is most likely a viral infection like the common cold it takes a few weeks for the symptoms to get relieved but there is not much that we can do besides", "d supportive care so make sure you get you stay well hydrated you can use over the counter medications like tylenol cold now if you to relieve some of your symptoms but since right now we are in a pandemic some of these symptoms can also be seen in covid patients so we will also get a swab done for you today and you should have the results back by 48 hours", "d until then we recommend that you stay isolated in your own home and not see anyone else and then once the results come

have any questions for me anything you wanted to add p no i think that is you covered", "p everything d ok alright so i will will go off a few we will try to cover our basis and get you tested for mono which i would have to do like a monospot test and we can do rapid strep test as well to see if he has something called strep throat but yeah we will see what those results come back as and we

fairly clear and sometimes like a bit white but like it is not like green or yellow d ok and have you felt that it is difficult to breathe in through either of your nostrils like it is obstructed p yeah so at night sometimes", "p i have to like turn because one side of my nose gets difficult to breathe from and then it kind of balances out on the other side so yeah i do have some obstruction d ok and have you had any changes to your sense of smell p yeah so just in the last 3 days when the congestion got really bad i started losing the ability to smell", "d ok have you had any changes to your sense of taste p no taste is fine d ok and have you had any cough or sore throat p no no cough or sore throat d ok and the symptoms have gone on for 5 days have you had a period of time where you

not that i know of d alright and how about any cancer in the family p no no cancers d ok i think i that was everything", "d i wanted to ask about today was there any other symptoms or anything else that you wanted to make sure i knew about today p no i think that is all i just did not know if i needed any like medications or if i needed to get tested i just wanted to make sure d yeah so well certainly check your temperature to see", "d if you have a fever and if you do and it is high enough that will increase the chance that you have a bacterial sinusitis and if so with some of your symptoms including the discharge obstruction loss of smell and facial pain that all fits the picture for it and also you had", "d a period where you felt a little bit better and then worse again so that might require antibiotics but we will check your temperature and go from there p alright sounds good thank you so much d thank you", "d what brings you in today p so i have been having just a worsening breathlessness i have been also having a cough and i think i might have also had a fever in the last couple weeks d ok so the breathlessness started 6 weeks ago correct p yeah d ok and then

i would say 2 to 3 weeks d ok ok and do you how often are you having this breathlessness p i would say it is pretty much there", "p most of the time it sometimes gets worse when i am exerting myself but i think just baseline i feel like i have been able to breathe less heavily than before d ok so alright and how long does it last when you do get it or is it just always there p it is kind of just there but then when it is getting worse like it lasts", "p a couple minutes to i would say like 10 to 15 minutes and then it goes back to like just the normal breathlessness d ok and if you were to describe the quality of your breathlessness would you say that it feels like a kind of like a burning feeling like you are having a hard time catching your breath or does it feel like you are breathing too fast", "p i think it is more i just can not seem to take like deep breaths and then when i get breathless i i really try to take a deep breath but i just can not find myself catching my breath at that time so it is just more not being able to catch my breath d ok sure and are there things that make make it better or worse", "p not really i think it is sometimes moving around too much but like nothing nothing really causes it d ok and was there any sort of trigger 6 weeks ago that you think may have like caused all of your symptoms p 0 i am not sure i i do not think there was any triggers d ok", "d has anyone around you been sick p so there there are some people living in my house that have a bad cough over the last few weeks d ok p so yeah d so they have similar symptoms to you as well then p yeah some of them like do not really have the shortness of breath and it is just like a cough d ok p but yeah there are some of them also have some shortness of", "p breath d ok ok and have you traveled anywhere recently p so i actually came to canada one year ago i am originally from india and i i am i came here to study d ok ok alright if you were to rate your breathlessness from one to 10", "d 10 being the worst how bad is your breathlessness p it can get pretty bad like i i would say up to an 8 sometimes maybe a couple times a week d ok and have you ever experienced this before p no this is like the 1st time i am having this issue d ok and do you feel like it is getting worse better has it changed since you started having", "d these symptoms p i think it is getting worse and that is why i was getting a bit scared and i came here d ok yeah that was a good call and have you had any changes to your smell recently p no no changes to smell d any anything like a runny nose or stuffy nose p no not really no", "d no ok how about a sore throat p no no sore throat d no sore throat any changes to your taste p nope d any changes in hearing p nope d ear pain or discharge from your ears p no nothing like that d ok any eye pain p no d changes in your vision p nope d any discharge from your eyes", "p nope d ok and you mentioned fever and some night sweats how often are you getting these night sweats and do they feel like chills p i think in the last 2 weeks i have been getting it more frequently like i would say every other night i i feel i would feel chilly at one and then i will break out into night sweats", "p or have to take off my blanket i think i measured it once or twice over the week and it did show like a fever of 102 d ok ok ok and any changes to your skin like rashes p no nothing like that d any weight loss p i would say i think i am losing a little bit of weight over the last couple weeks", "p i have not really weighed myself but i feel that i have lost some weight d ok yeah and the coughing are you coughing up any blood p i do not think so sometimes like when i cough up like sputum there is like a little bit of pink pink tinged sputum as well sometimes", "p it is like brownish in color and sometimes it is green but i have not actually coughed up any blood d ok and you said there is some sputum like pink tinged sputum how much sputum would you say you cough up every time you cough p maybe like a like a spoonful i would say", "d and do you ever feel like you are wheezing p no i i do not think so i i do not really notice any noises when i am breathing d ok and alright so any chest pain p no no chest pain at all d ok how about swelling in your legs or in your limbs", "p leg swelling d no leg swelling ok how about do you feeling like your heart is racing p no d no ok ok and any nausea or vomiting p no no nausea or vomitting d how about changes in your bowel movements p no d ok how about changes in urinating", "p no it has been fine d alright any headaches p no headaches d any dizziness or fainting spells p no nothing like that d ok no confusion or memory loss p no d ok and are you otherwise healthy do you have any medical conditions p i think when i was back in india a couple years ago", "p they did give me some antibiotics for like a chest infection but i could not really afford the medications and did not take them i did not finish the course but other than that nothing else d ok did they mention what type of chest infection it could have been p no i do not really remember i think it was some kind of pneumonia", "d ok are you on any medications p just i take tylenol sometimes like it has not really been helping d ok and are you allergic to anything p no not that i know d ok are you up to date with all your immunizations p yeah as far as i know d ok", "d and is there any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions p nope d no ok how about cancers p no cancers that run in the family no d ok ok so you mentioned you moved to canada from india about a year back where do you live now p so i live in it is we have like a student house with some", "p of the students who came from india as well and there is 6 of us living together in in a house d ok ok and are they sick as well or no p yeah so 3 of them actually have like 2 of them have a cough and one of them has some shortness of breath as well d ok and have they been to a doctor have they been investigated were they ever given a diagnosis", "p no not that i know of i think i might be the 1st one who actually went to a doctor d ok ok do you smoke p i smoke like i would say like 5 cigarettes a day d ok how long have you been smoking for p around 10 years d ok that is it has been a while then and do you do you drink alcohol", "p i do not drink and i do not do any drugs either d ok ok are you sexually active p not currently no d no ok have you ever had unprotected sex p no d no ok ok did you have any questions or concerns anything you wanted to discuss that i had not asked you about", "p so yeah this is just like my 1st time visiting a doctor in this country and like i was just very scared that it might be something serious so just wanted to know what it can be d yeah for sure so the 1st thing we want to rule out is tb because you have recently moved to canada from a country where it is i believe it is endemic", "d so and some of your most of your symptoms fit with tb and how it presents so we just want to make sure it is not that because it is highly infectious and and we do not want it to spread so we can do like a afb smear or i think they have other diagnostic work up for that too so we will do that 1st", "d if not we can check to see if it is like another another typical pneumonia we can do a chest x ray for that as well if both of those turn out to be negatives then we will have to work you up further for other things like copd or lung cancer how does that sound p that sounds good thank you", "d what brings you here today p i have had a new cough that started this week it has been going on the last like 3 or 4 days and i have had a headache and but yesterday i just noticed that i have not been able to to smell so i wanted to come in this morning d ok yeah so it has been going on for the last 4 days is it", "p it is dry d it is dry ok are you at all bringing up any kind of sputum or blood at all p no i have not been d ok and have you been experiencing any kind of fevers or chills p yeah i feel i have felt feverish and i think that yeah that is kind of started", "p like within the last day d ok and did you get a temperature at all p no i have just been really feeling yeah feverish and feeling really hot d ok and besides the cough are you having any other symptoms like muscle aches or headaches p yeah i have been having a headache", "p know on and off for this past 3 or 4 days as well and i have had muscle aches my whole body kind of aches d ok and when did this start p that has been over the past like 3 days or so yeah i woke up and i have just been feeling yeah achy and just not feeling good d ok yeah so it all just kind of started in the last 4 days are you having any kind", "d of fainting or dizziness episodes at all p no i have not had anything like that d ok and any are your symptoms getting worse at all p no they well i initially they did but they have kind of stayed the same d ok and have you had any loss of sense of taste or smell", "p i have i have had a loss of smell and taste now that you mention it yeah d and when did that happen p within the last 2 days d ok and are you having any runny nose congestion sore throat any of those symptoms p no not really nothing like that d ok have you traveled at all recently", "p i have not traveled have not traveled anywhere but i i have just been going to work and and being at at home d ok and where do you go for work p i am a nurse actually at the at a a walk in clinic d ok and have you at all been exposed to", "d anyone who has been sick anyone who has tested positive for covid p no nobody that i am aware of that is that is tested positive but there has been people recently that within the past week that we have seen come in with with cough and things like like that so d ok are you having any nausea or vomiting", "p no i have not had anything like that d ok any night sweats p no d any chest pain or shortness of breath p no d ok any changes in your bowel movements any diarrhea constipation p no d any changes in your urination p no nothing like that", "d no burning sensation or pain at all p no nothing like that d ok any changes in your sleep or appetite recently p yeah just these past couple of days i have not really felt like eating much my sleep has been ok but i think that is just because i have not been feeling well so just have not really wanted to eat d ok any weight changes recently p no", "p i i wish d ok and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past at all p no i have been i have been i have been healthy d ok and do you take any medications on a regular basis p just the the multi vitamin and then a like a greens supplement", "d green supplement p yeah it is just sort of like a like a green powder it is supposed to replace i do not know one of your servings of vegetables for the day d ok and have you been hospitalized or had any surgeries in the past p i i had like a scope on my knee when i was like a teenager i injured it playing soccer but that is it", "d ok any family history of any heart or lung conditions p my my grandfather had had lung cancer but he smoked his whole life d ok and currently so you work as a nurse what is your living situation like do you live with anyone do you live in house", "p d ok has anyone in the house had similar symptoms or been feeling sick lately p no it is just been me yeah my wife and daughter have been both staying home i have been the one only one really kind of leaving the house for well going to work and then getting most of the groceries and that that", "p thing since i am already out d ok ok and currently do you smoke at all p no cigarettes well i smoke weed every once in awhile d ok and how often would you say you smoke weed p probably like probably once a week just yeah just on the weekend maybe once d ok and do you drink", "p a couple of beers on the weekend like one or 2 d ok ok so those are all the questions i had for you today do you have any questions or concerns p just a bit concerned possibly about covid d ok yeah so that is definitely with you working in the in the hospital clinical setting there", "d is definitely a possibility and a lot of the symptoms that you are having overlap with covid symptoms so we will definitely get a covid swab test done for you today it usually comes back in the next 24 to 48 hours and until then i would recommend that you isolate either in a room separately wear a mask around your family members isolate to the best of your abilities not go outside see", "d if someone else can get groceries for you guys as well and then depending on the test public health will contact", "d so i understand you removed insects from your leg earlier today p yes i did it was it was behind my left knee kind of in like the joint behind where it bends it was stuck pretty good it is still kind of red and tender there i noticed it because the back of my knee was starting to just feel a bit sore not the joint itself but just kind of the skin the whole area back", "p there and i found this tick i brought i brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it it is in like this little plastic container and i do not really know when i got it i was hiking on friday and then saturday i was out in my garden i hope they are not around my house i hope that it was from hiking and not gardening but i did spend a lot of time outside", "p on saturday as well d ok so sounds like it has been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors to when you 1st noticed it p yeah d ok so when you picked it off the tick obviously you have it for me is it quite swollen or engorged p it is not too bad i i have actually had a tick in the past and this is a long time ago and maybe like 10", "p years and i actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about and at that time i remember i had to take antibiotics for a bit this did not look like that it was more it was just kind of sore in one spot i do not think it it was as bad as that time and the tick that", "p time sorry i have kind of gotten off track that time it was quite swollen this one was maybe a little bit but not as much d ok so just in terms of the tick is size it does not look like it has been feeding for too long so when ticks are feeding they tend to engorge they tend to swell up so this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape almost like it has been swollen up with blood p no this one this one is pretty small", "d this one is pretty small ok and i should mention that well obviously you have had a tick bite in the past the big concern for us is a disease called lyme disease which is spread by bacteria but in fact only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission transmitory agent for it it is called a deer tick and its coloration it has got a little bit of a brown butt and there is some black legs does it look like that at all p i do not think so", "p i was looking at the pictures online i think it looks like the other kind of tick but i heard that yeah but i heard that lately now they have been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of lyme because i think it is kind of become more more of a problem sm so that was making me a bit nervous", "d ok absolutely what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they will be able to identify the species for it but for tick bites in general one of the key considerations is for how long it has been on your body for so unfortunately if you are out on friday and saturday that would mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours so i think one way or another we are likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least just want to make sure", "d that you are not at risk of developing lyme disease i am sure you have heard from the news that lyme disease can present in a variety of ways but it is a disease that we try our best to avoid and just in terms of your symptoms so you say you have had a bite in the past and you you have got that rash before that kind of bullseye rash do you have that rash now p no i do not as far as i know i mean you can have a look too it is behind my knee so it is not the easiest place to see but it is it looks a little", "p like tender where the tick was but i do not see that like larger circle rash d ok that is reassuring now any it would be pretty unlikely for you to have other symptoms but just in case do you have any other joint pain p no d have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while p no no i have been fine d ok and you removed that twit tick once you found it you presented", "d to me have you checked your body for any other possible bites p 0 yeah i looked around and i looked at my husband too cause we we were just a little bit you know gave us a little bit of a scare but no there has been nothing else d that is good and did you bring a pet with you at all when you were hiking and gardening p no i did not no d ok good any other family members you think might have been exposed p no it was just", "p me and my husband d ok and what geographic area were you in when you were hiking p we were in strathroy along the creek d ok i can do if i remember there is a lyme disease distribution map for ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not", "d looks like strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point so i think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics but of course we will be talking to the physician who will be having a look at you as well so it sounds like you have not been having too much symptoms aside from you have noticed this tick the skin around it is fairly sore and you have had this in the past but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you have not had too many health problems after that p no", "p no i have been pretty healthy d ok and just about your health right now is there anything that you see the family physician or doctor for in general and regarding your health p just for my cholesterol d ok are you taking and medications for that p yeah i take a statin can not remember which one d ok got it and do you have any allergies p no d so no drug allergies p no", "d ok now we have already talked about other exposures so it does not sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around so it is unlikely that you have ticks coming in and you said you might have gotten this from gardening but you are hoping that your area does not have ticks maybe just take a look ticks like to live in long grass kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there is any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they are sometimes easy to spot you might want to get", "d some insecticide out there but it sounds like this is fairly recent unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for it is probably safer than not to start you on some medications but i am going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it definitively as well as might just send some blood work just to see if there is any titres or any serology that would make us", "d a little bit more concerned for lyme disease but aside from that you have been feeling well otherwise p yeah totally fine it was just a little tender there and that is the only reason i looked d ok so no headaches p no d nothing like that p nothing like that d ok excellent alright i am fairly happy with what we talked about today do you have any questions for me jean p no this is pretty well what i expected today so thanks for helping me out d no problem ok i will go talk to the doctor we will come back and talk to you", "d ok p great thanks d thanks jean", "d what brings you in p hi i am just coming in here today because i have been just on wall recently over the last i would say 3 to 4 days i started getting these like really bad muscle pains all throughout my body and then over the past few days i have also been feeling chilly so uhm i wonder if i have a fever and i have also just been having this cough for the last few days as well", "d ok what started 1st p i think the muscle pain started 1st and then it

the cough started when p cough started 3 days ago d ok", "d before the muscle aches started did you like do anything different in your life like you know do a lot of exercise or any other strenuous activities p no i i have not really changed my routine at all d ok and where specifically like wha which muscles ache p pretty much like throughout my body but i would say more so like upper back my", "p thighs then my arms yeah kind of just all over d ok any joint pains as well p no i do not think so d ok and is it hard for you to walk like use your arms do you have any sort of like motor weakness

2 glasses of whiskey in a in an average week d ok ok alright and have you been in touch with or in contact with anyone sick recently", "p no no one has been sick uhm i do meet up with some friends on

some imaging done as well to see if it is more in line with bronchiolitis or pneumonia if it is bronchiolitis it will be supportive treatment so we can keep him here at the hospital because he is in some distress and we will keep him hydrated and give him some oxygen and if it is pneumonia we will prescribe him some antibiotics", "d how does that sound p yeah and will he need to stay in the hospital at all d yeah so for now because if he is in any distress and if he needs oxygen and iv hydration he will need to stay in the hospital until he is better from that standpoint i should also

which could be from an animal like a parrot or a cat that is causing just a reaction and it is bringing these symptoms on like called hypersensitivity pneumonitis but also we can not rule out asthma as well as being a trigger of kind of the cough and shortness of breath is being around allergens as well so we will order pulmonary function test", "d and maybe some imaging and chest x ray and we

symptoms that you have shared with me it sounds like you might have something called", "d rhinosinusitis which is basically inflammation of the sinuses and of the of the nasal cavity or the area inside your nose and often it is just treated with conservative management so just continue to take tylenol if that seems to help you and do the steam therapy it will take time to get better but if you feel that", "d it is it is not getting better in the next week or so give us a call again and we can maybe see if it is a bacterial infection and see if if antibiotics might be needed but oftentimes it is usually a viral infection and antibiotics are not needed and sort of just resting and taking care of yourself and trying to manage the symptoms that way can help but also check", "d

chronic congestion you may be also having something called obstruct obstructive sleep apnea and there can be structures in your mouth throats that can cause you to kind of obstruct and snore at night

weeks d and if you were to rate it on a scale", "d of 0 to 100 being no pain and 10 being like the worst pain you have ever felt where would it fall p i would say a 4 out of 10 d ok can you think of anything that that you have done differently recently that could have brought it on or is there any kind of common factor between the times that you had the pain", "p i do not know i have separated from my husband 22 years ago which has been really stressful but other than that i mean i can not really think of any changes to my health or anything like that recently d ok but do you feel like you

when you have these these symptoms and that and you know people in your life that have had", "d similar issues in the past i do not know that this is related to that i i personally do not think so at this point but we are definitely going to do everything to look into it and and rule out something that would be scary like that i am going to ask you few more questions about your lifestyle in general do you smoke cigarettes p yeah i smoke", "p about half a pack to a pack per day i have been trying to quit and i was smoking more one pack per day but so it is down a little bit but it is

summarize what we have talked about", "d over the last 2 weeks you started having these 20 to 30 minute episodes of chest pain that is on the left side it feels more sharp is that correct p yeah d and it is kind of constant when it comes on there is nothing really that makes it better or worse it just kind of goes away on its own after half an hour or so it has kind of stayed", "d the same over

of history that you are giving me it sounds like she has something called a radial head subluxation and that is usually caused in young children when they are like pulled or lifted by the hand or wrist while", "d their arm is held straight which can kind of pull the bone out of its socket a little bit so in terms of like a management plan you can try conservative things like ice packs over the counter painkillers otherwise we can try to put the radius back into its normal position", "d here which will just take like a few minutes and and then after we reduce it back into its place she

been found to be invalid and like they have been invalidated by the research so definitely it is very important to get your child vaccinated in fact the sum of the symptoms that your child may be having right now can be caused by something called pertussis and there is usually a vaccination for that", "d like after pregnancy as well so that is something that is definitely on the differential

fairly young but if there was ever an injury in the past it you can have early osteoarthritis in the area so we just want to get an x ray and other than that the way we kind of deal with this issue is usually conservatively and with a splint p ok d and a sling for your thumb that helps relieve some of these symptoms", "d restricts some of your movements reduces some of the swelling and if it does

reasons that you were visiting farms and like being around birds or anything like that p not really but i i do think like the old building that we lived in might have had asbestos does", "p that does that like count at all d like a it could be important because well how long how long did you live there for p i would say almost 20 years d ok so yes that definitely would be is is important for the history today because unfortunately long term exposure to asbestos", "d when breathing it in can cause some of the symptoms that you have been describing along with cough and respiratory symptoms so

asked on history was there anything that else you wanted to tell me p no i think that is all d ok so next we will do your physical exam and order some investigations but currently thinking that it could be related to asbestos exposure as", "d well as something called well it could cause pulmonary fibrosis and then also the joint pains that you have been experiencing might be another symptom that is suggestive of a connective tissue disease and it does not sound like you have a family history of those but we will do some lab work and investigations for for those including a chest", "d x ray and a chest ct p sounds good", "d what brings you all in today p essentially when he so today is friday when he got home from school on wednesday he seemed fine but he i do not know that night he

any sputum or blood p no d no ok good ok and does he sound wheezy at all to you p no no not that i have noticed d ok how about short of breath p i do not think so like he usually he is a really active kid and he has he has not been running a lot outside", "p in the past couple days so maybe he maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing but also i think he is just been tired in general d ok yeah ok and is his coughing getting worse with certain times of the day like is it worse at night in the morning p i think it kinda just there the whole day d ok", "d and does it how does it sound does this sound like a barky cough does it sound like harsh what is what would you say the quality of it of the sound of the cough is p i just sounds kind of dry it is not like super loud d ok ok and has he ever", "d experienced anything like this in the past p i do not like he is had colds before but i have not like i have not like you this time he kind of had the fever which is different than you know having a regular cold d ok and are his symptoms getting worse p i think so because yeah he 1st day he just seemed like little", "p dry and then yesterday is coughing and today he actually has a fever d ok and is he complaining of anything like chest pain or feeling like his heart is racing p no i do not think so d no ok does he have a sore throat p i do not", "p think so d ok and is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids p i do not know if he is having trouble swallowing but he does not seem to have a big appetite right now d ok and is he does he have a blocked nose or runny nose p maybe a bit of like a runny nose", "d ok and does he have any issues with smell or taste p ah this morning he really seemed like he was not like into his breakfast and i wonder if

nails or skin like rashes p no i have not noticed anything like that d ok any changes in his bowel movements p no d pardon p i am sorry no changes d ok no diarrhea no constipation no blood in the stool p no d ok any nausea", "d or vomiting p no d ok any changes in his urine p really been looking but i do not think so d any dizziness or fainting spells p no just like fatigue d ok any confusion or memory loss p no d and is he", "d an otherwise healthy child p yeah absolutely he has not like decide to like vaccines he has not had to go to the doctor like ever i mean he broke his arm once but that was it d ok so no past illnesses and i guess no hospitalizations or surgeries except for the broken arm p exactly like nothing", "d ok and were things normal with your pregnancy with him p yeah totally d ok ah and then how about as a newborn any complications after birth p no no like everything was things really good d ok and then did he hit all his milestones up till now p yeah totally", "d does he have any allergies p uhm no no i do not think so i mean like he has not really taken a lot of medicine so it is hard to say but like nothing so far d is he up to date with all his immunizations p yep d yeah ok and in terms of family history are there any lung conditions or", "d heart conditions p no everyone is really healthy d ok and are there and who does he live with and where does he live p he lives with me and my husband and he has a little sister like just in town here d ok and is she healthy p yeah i like she yeah she is", "p healthy d ok an any concerns for old carpets mold asbestos or any environmental issues like that in the home that you are in p no d no ok has he been around any sick contacts recently p not not like outside of school i like we know for sure not outside of school but he goes to school right now so kind of", "p hard to say they have not like contacted us about anything d ok sure and has he traveled anywhere recently p no d no ok ok well those are all the questions i had for you today were was there anything that i missed that you wanted to chat about today p i do not think so like i", "p realized that i can often times like we do not really do much for kids when you know when it is just like a virus or something but we do i guess need to have a covid test to go back to school even if you know either way cause they want us to be able to say it is like the other kids have had an exposure d mhmm p so yeah yeah like sorry go", "p ahead d no go ahead p so i just wanted to basically see if it was that and i mean he does receive you are so scared that is kind of what made me come in like it is scaring me a little bit d right yeah ok so 1st thing is 1st we need to do a covid swab just to make sure that he either has it or it does not have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours umm we do suggest because his symptoms overlap", "d with symptoms of covid that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister if possible and then if the swap comes back negative there is a chance for false negatives but also it could be another viral illness that is going around nowadays if his symptoms get worse so if he has a really high temperature", "d if he has any neurological symptoms like seizures or if he is feeling weak dizzy if he has any fainting spells please do take him to the er and uhm so for now i will just wait for those covid swabs to come back how does that sound p yeah sounds good d ok great p thank you d yeah no worries uhm and i should have mentioned if it", "d was

is high increases your risk of developing a clot so i would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking and so we will do an ultrasound of your leg and we will do a scan of your chest and see what is going on and then decide if we need", "d to give you any medications like any blood thinning medications p ok yeah that sounds really good thank you

sounds good thank you so much", "d what brings you here today p so i am here because my shoulder has been really painful for the past week and any movement of that shoulder of my right shoulder causes a lot of pain d ok and how long have you been having this pain for p for the past week d past week ok and did you injure your shoulder at all recently any trauma to the area or anything like that", "p so about like a couple of months ago i was do i i work in construction so i was moving around some heavy objects and i guess like the repetitive motions caused some sort of rotator cuff injury but i had that like i got that treated and everything was fine for a couple of months", "p but this pain just started a week ago d ok and where is this pain located exactly p it is it is just like in my shoulder like at the joint between my upper arm and shoulder d ok and is it an aching pain or is it a sharp stabbing pain p so at rest it seems to be like achy and stiff", "p but when i move my shoulder when i try to move it it it causes more of a sharp pain d sharp pain ok and what kind of movements cause the sharp pain or is it just any movement p any movement d ok are there any movements that are worse in particular p i think", "p like no anything hurts d ok ok and how much would you rate this pain out on a scale of 0 to 10 10 being the worst pain you felt in your life p i would give

notice any kind of just looking at your shoulder outside from the outside any swelling redness any masses or deformities p no i do not see anything like that d ok alright and is there anything that you have tried that has helped with your pain p i have tried some ibuprofen some ice it seems to", "p help temporarily d ok and earlier when you had the rotator cuff injury did you get physiotherapy p i did but not but i did not finish the full course i just went for a week or so and then i had to go back to work so i stopped doing that d i see yeah so that is something definitely it is very important", "d and we will need to consider going forward as well other than that are you having any symptoms of any fevers or chills p no nothing like that d ok and have you been sick recently at all or met with someone who was sick p no d ok any any weight loss or loss of appetite anything like", "d that p no nothing like that d ok any numbness or tingling p no d any weakness in your extremities p no d any any just symptoms or anything else like diarrhea constipation urinary changes anything else is going on p no d no ok so it is mainly just the shoulder pain p yes d ok", "d alright and does rest help at all like when you are lying down just not moving your shoulder does that help with your pain p yeah i would say so d ok and is is this stiffness there just throughout the day or is it there in the morning and then gets better during the day p it is pretty much there all day d ok alright", "d have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past p i have i have diabetes

right p yes d and are you off of work right now or have you been off work due to your", "d previous injury and pain or are you still working p i am still working but modified so i am not lifting any heavy objects or anything like that i am just doing some like groundwork d ok that is good yeah i mean we might also need to if you are doing any kind of overhead like work where you are raising your arms above your shoulders that might cause further problems as well so we will look into", "d yeah and what is your living situation like right now who do you live with p i live by myself right now d do you live in a house or apartment p i live in an apartment d and in terms of your daily life do you smoke at all p i do not smoke i used to smoke before", "p but that was like 20 years ago d ok that is good and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana or any other drugs p no no d how about smoking you smoke cigarettes sorry you said you you quit do you drink alcohol p i will drink like a glass of wine here and there d ok alright", "d yeah and those were some of the questions i had for you in terms of just a physical examination when you press on the area that you describe when you press around the area does it hurt p i have to press pretty hard for it to hurt d ok but otherwise it is not tender p no d ok and again no swelling redness or anything like that just it is mainly just on the inside p yeah", "d and any kind of movement hurts right there is no particular movement that like if you were instead of trying to raise that shoulder by itself if you were to just move it with the other arm does it hurt p the other arm the other arm does not hurt at all d or like if you were to use your left arm to to passively move your right arm", "d and shoulder does that hurt or is it when you just try to move the right arm by itself p it is 0 it still hurts any any moving of the shoulder hurts d ok alright so yeah so based on what you have told me so far in your recent shoulder cuff injury what can sometimes happen is with those injuries you might get", "d some inflammation and what might happen is something called adhesive capsulitis or just commonly knows as known as a frozen shoulder and there is different stages so that might happen so in the initial stages like freezing and then there is stiffening in stage 2 and then usually after 6 to 12 months", "d it starts getting better p ok d and it might also affect your other shoulder as well so what we will end up doing today is see if we can get some imaging done so we can do an x ray of your shoulder i am sure you have had x rays before so we will kind of compare them to your shoulder", "d rays from before we if we need to we can also get an ultrasound if we do not we can not really tell from the x rays and then from there we can get some blood work as well just your normal blood work as well as inflammation markers and then from there we will need to", "d really discuss some management strategies so you have already tried some physiotherapy but now we need to make sure that is it is it is consistent because this is something that has a high recurrence rate and we will definitely need to finish the full course", "d injections right into your shoulder p ok d for some relief but yeah so 1st we will just try some conservative methods like physiotherapy pain management and then go from there how does that sound p that sounds pretty good thank you d welcome alright so we will call you for the x rays and then we will go from there p ok sounds good", "d what brings you in today p i can not i can barely breathe for like 2 days now and i have been coughing and been having like a little bit of pain in my chest d ok the pain in your chest can you point out or can you describe the pain to me is that sharp", "p it is hard to say i have not really had this before it is more like it just kind of hurts just in the middle and it gets worse like when i cough and when i if i take like a really deep breath it will hurt yeah does that make sense d yeah so the shortness of breath and chest pain they occurred simultaneously right", "d on the same day like 2 days ago p yeah i mean now that i think of it i maybe started coughing a little bit earlier than that but when it got harder to breathe is pretty well around the same time that i started feeling more the pain d ok alright so let us focus on the coughing 1st are you coughing up any blood at all", "p d ok and how about sputum p i guess i guess it feels like there is some like mucus i do not know kind kind of like spit looking but maybe like thicker than that d ok is it yellow", "p yeah it is creamy yellow d ok sure and are you wheezing with the cough p i i do not think so d no ok and is it is your shortness of breath worse with exertion p i have not been doing much really cause i have just been so wiped", "p probably i guess it is kind of i am really you know have not been getting up very much i am normally really active like i i train for triathlons and i i am not like a couch potato right and i feel like i have been just kind of sitting down d ok do you have the chest pain at rest as well or is it just with the coughing", "p like if i take a deep breath i will have it but no i do not think not not like right now not like just sitting here d ok and the coughing how often are you coughing p 0 like it kind of varies i feel like i get up in the night kind of sweaty and i will cough for for a while and it it will keep me up and then during the day it is like", "p i might go you know a couple hours without but then i will cough and i will kind of keep going for a few minutes so it is a lot like probably yeah i probably do not go more than like 2 hours without d ok ok and how far can you walk before you start feeling shortness of breath p i mean i have not been walking very", "p far like i i walked in here from the parking lot and that was fine but i am tired d ok ok and i just want to ask you some

been like really hot and sweaty kinda gross like feel like i just i", "p feel like soaked and but yeah i do not have a thermometer d ok so these night events that you are describing are they more

no d ok and have you noticed any swelling", "d you noticed any swelling p i do not think so no d ok any palpitations like you feel like your heart is racing p no d no and then how about in terms of like your abdominal system any pain there p 0 no nothing i mean it is like a little sore just cause i am coughing all the time but yeah but yeah not not like not anything", "p like noticeable d ok and then how about your stools have they been normal p yeah yeah d and then how about your urine is that has everything been normal from that standpoint p yeah yeah d ok ok and then have you had any issues with breathing or", "d coughing in the past p no i mean i like i said i am really active i do a lot of like right i have been like training for a triathlon like i have not had any problems before d ok ok any any past medical conditions that you know of", "p a type one diabetic d ok ok have you ever ok have you ever had a pulmonary function test in the past p well maybe when i was like kid or like a teenager d and any recent chest x rays ecg is any other investigations you have done so far p no like i have been i have been really healthy d ok good", "d and are you on any medications p like i take a my insulin d yeah p and like i take i take a statin is that what it is called d ok is that because you have high triglycerides", "d or like cholesterol p i they just said cause i like

problems so like she also my family doctor knows my dad", "p too so i do not know if that has something to do with it d ok ok and then yeah i guess i will talk about family history since you brought it up any lung issues in the family p not that i know of like d ok p just i mean the heart like my dad had a heart attack i do not know if that counts as like it is close to the", "p was not that long ago he was like in his 60s d ok p yeah d ok i am going to name a few things and you let me know if this is in your history ok in your family history asthma p maybe like my cousin but yeah not like my mom or dad d ok cystic fibrosis p no", "d ok alpha one antitrypsin deficiency p i do not think so no d pulmonary fibrosis p no no d ok ok and are you up to date with all your immunizations p like i i

"p from home i have not even been around there so i did not get it this year but i have all the normal ones d ok and then do you smoke jessica p no d no do you smoke marijuana p no no d any other

what what kind of work do you do jessica p i am an accountant d ok and have you traveled anywhere recently i know with covid obviously that is hard p i wish", "p i wish i wish but you know i have not

not know like i have been to the like the states before covid", "p t i did not really have not traveled anywhere cool in a long time d ok ok so just kind of going through what it could be that you have right now i am thinking a few things and we kind of like to go through and make sure we are not missing anything so in terms of like vascular stuff it could be something", "a like like chf or pulmonary embolism and that stands for congestive heart failure but you are very young you seem like you are very healthy so that is probably lower on our differential obviously p ok yeah hopefully d an infection would be the biggest one right now with the cough with it seems like you have chills and", "d night sweats yeah so would have to do more in terms of taking your temperature and see if you can do like more work up like a chest x ray to see what is happening in there autoimmune stuff could be like sarcoidosis but unlikely cause it seems like this is an acute issue for you", "p see i never come in besides like because i you know need my insulin i never even go to the i did not even want to come in and just like it was not going away d yeah yeah and then other things like copd pulmonary fibrosis and like like cancer stuff is super low on the differential right now so yeah so", "l so yeah so for right now we will start we can start by doing some blood work 1st i do a physical exam of course and then from there we would kind of do some blood work to see if your white blood cell count is high and then we can do a chest x ray to see if there is like a consolidation if there is pneumonia or you know", "l or anything viral do you have any questions anything that you wanted to add that i missed p i do not think i do not think so yeah i just hope i can get feeling better hope it is not anything serious like i i think yeah i just hope it is like i hope like you said it is like i got like an infection or something and it will just be gone soon d yeah yeah it", "d does sound like it from the timeline like you started coughing 2 days ago and then the difficulty breathing or shortness of breath also 2 days ago and then the chest pain just seems like it is from you coughing a lot p it can do that d yeah p ok yeah d yeah ok so i guess we will see you at our follow up", "d after all of these investigations are done", "d hear you have been having some some nausea vomiting diarrhea can you tell me a little more about that p yeah so like around 3 or 4 days ago i started to get really nauseous and since then i have been vomiting every few hours and really

were feeling", "d well p yeah well i was feeling maybe like a little tired for a day or 2 before but i do not know sometimes you just feel like that so i did not really think much of it but d sure ok and since it started have i know these all kind of started at different times but has have your symptoms gotten worse overtime p yeah", "p they they have gotten worse at 1st they were kinda really spread it like far enough apart that i would thought it was just going to go away on its own and then it it has not so has me concerned d ok i am just going to ask you a few more questions about the vomiting have you noticed any blood in your vomit p no it has been kind of yellowish d ok and just if you notice like", "d like a really bright kind of yellow green substance in your vomit p umm not

symptoms then than simply respiratory symptoms so i think we should probably give you a covid swab and then we ask that you and everyone in your house self isolates for a few days until you have got it in a negative result and in a few days without symptoms p ok that sounds good d so yeah we will get that started for", "d you and otherwise really we want to know if it is covid is just for infection control purposes but i think that essentially you should be drinking lots of fluids and getting a lot of rest and it is something that likely should go away on its own i mean if things start to become a lot worse and you get really dehydrated and you have fevers that you can not control", "d with tylenol then please come back to the emergency department but i think in general it will just be kind of supportive treatments for what you are experiencing p ok that sounds good i will get some gatorade on the way home d perfect actually do not go into the store have someone else get it for

sure d yeah ok alright so i will go back to your past medical history have you been hospitalized or have you ever needed surgeries in the past", "p the last time i was in the hospital with it was for a colonoscopy a few years ago which came back normal d ok that is good are you up to date with all your immunizations p yeah actually got the shingles vaccine a few months ago d ok p probably closer to a year ago now actually d 0 great ok that is awesome", "d and are you allergic to anything p just peanuts d peanuts ok do you know if you have a family history of any lung or heart conditions p

have any questions or concerns that you wanted to bring up before we ended the interview p well i am just hoping to to get this sorted out and feel better d yeah for sure so you know right now we are thinking it could be a viral gi viral infection because of your complaints of nausea vomiting", "d loss of appetite and fever but it could also be covid and we are going to have to do a swab for you and run that test because you have a lot of symptoms that overlap with those symptoms and then so just going off of that we will wait for the swabs to come back if they come back positive we will notify public health and they will do a trace to see where you could have gotten", "d this infection from and then meanwhile we do suggest that you isolate for 2 weeks so that you do not spread the illness and even if the swab comes back negative there is still a chance that you may have covid and it is a false negative test so we will start there if it turns out you do not", "d have any of those viral illnesses and you have more of a you know bacterial picture we can work you up for that and prescribe antibiotics so that is where we will start how does that sound p yeah that sounds like a great start thank you d alright great", "d what brings you in here today p yeah i have just been feeling breathless and it is getting worse so i wanted to check it out d ok and when did you 1st start feeling breathless p about 2 months ago d ok and did it come on about like gradually through time or suddenly just happened p i guess gradually", "d how often do you feel breathless p i would say it is worse when i when i walk more than 50 meters that is kind of the main like that is kind of the main trigger just exertion d ok and were you able to walk normally more than 50 meters before 2 months", "p yeah 3 months ago i was fine d ok and do you have any other symptoms like cough or chest pain p i have a cough sometimes yeah d ok but nothing like constant p no d ok and do you have any wet cough or any productive cough or are you producing like sputum or phlegm", "p yeah i guess i would say i have this frothy sputum d ok and has your breathlessness been getting any worse at all over the last 2 months p i would say so yes d ok and you mentioned like exertion makes it worse but anything else like going outside or exposure to any chemicals that makes it worse", "p i do not think so d ok and how about a positional changes does lying flat at all make it worse p i would say so yes yeah i am basically gasping for air when i lay down d ok and do you ever find yourself waking up at night in the middle of the night to catch your breath p no d no ok and when do you feel the breathlessness the most", "d is it more so during the day or at night p i guess it is worse at night because i am laying down d ok great and in terms of how many flights of stairs you can climb before you start feeling breathless do you have a number p i would say like 3 4 d 3 or 4 steps", "d ok and was there anything new that happened in your life recently any new medical diagnosis recently or any travel that happened before you started having these symptoms p no nothing like that d ok and prior to 2 months have you ever had any similar experiences p prior to", "p to 2 months no d ok and does anything make it better like any positional changes makes the breathlessness go away p i guess when i i am not laying down or when i am laying down i try to add pillows stack pillows so that it gets better d ok and are you having any other symptoms", "d like sore throat runny nose chest pain dizziness anything like that p no d ok have you recently traveled outside of the country p no d have you recently had any surgeries p no recent surgeries no d ok any headache nausea or vomiting", "d any fevers or chills or night sweats p no d ok do you feel increasingly fatigued throughout the day p i would say so yeah d ok and any changes in your bowel movements at all p no d ok and any chest pain at all within the last", "d 2 months p no no chest pain d ok any swelling in your in your legs ankles or in your hands and arms p there is some swelling d ok and where do you where are you getting this swelling p around my legs d ok and how when did you 1st notice this p around the same time actually", "p 2 months ago d ok have you noticed any kind of fevers at all p no d ok have you been in contact with anyone that has been ill recently p no no d ok and have you been coughing up any blood at all p no d ok any weight loss p no d any night", "d sweats or chills p no d ok apart from the breathlessness when laying down any other issues with your sleep p no d any changes in your appetite p nope d ok have you had any recent infections like a cold at all p no d ok any exposure to tuberculosis in", "d the past p not that i know of d ok any exposure to fumes or dust within your home or work environment p no d ok any animals or pets in the house p no no d ok and in terms of your past medical history has anyone told you that you have anything like copd or any cardiovascular issues", "d like high blood pressure cholesterol p so yeah so i have high blood pressure diabetes and high cholesterol d ok and do you take any medications for this p yep so i take aspirin ramipril and simvastatin d ok and have you ever had any chest pain or heart attack in the", "d past p yeah actually i had a heart attack 4 years ago d ok and do you remember what they did for your heart attack p something like a stent or something d ok and since then you have been on these medications p yes d ok and after they managed your heart attack have you ever had similar symptoms to when you had your", "d heart attack p no no d nothing like that ok do you have any allergies to any medications

cashier d ok and has the shortness of breath been affecting your daily routine at home or at work at all p yeah i would say so it has been hard to make it to work and then standing around all day or if i have to go help out with something and exert myself too much i get short of breath d ok and at home do you currently live", "d with anyone or do you live by yourself p i live by myself d ok and do you live in an apartment or house p i live in an apartment d ok and are there any exposures like dust or mold or asbestos in your home environment p no d ok and currently do you smoke p not right

feel that you get 3 meals a day a well balanced diet", "p i would not say well balanced i am trying to eat healthier but does not always happen d ok and how about exercise do you find that your exercise levels or activity levels have gone down in the last 2 months p yes d ok alright is there any other questions or concerns that you have or something i may have missed to ask you today p no", "p i do not think so d ok so based on what we talked about from your swelling as well as breathlessness while laying down and your past history of a heart attack and high cholesterol it may be likely with the medications you are on as well as your history that you might be having what is called congestive heart failure so we will need to do further", "d investigations to determine if that is what it is and if we need to get you on something like lasix or a diuretic to get rid of some of the fluid that is building up in your body which may be caused by heart failure so we will do some investigations and then go from there", "d what brings you in p yeah so i just came in because i have been having this cough that is getting worse over the last one.5 week and i have also just recently in the last few days been getting some shortness of breath and i also noticed my bowel movements have changed a little bit as well over the last week d ok so yeah let us break this down", "d the cough when did that start p the cough i think it started probably like around 10 days ago d 10 days ago ok and how about the shortness of breath p that just started in", "p it also started in like i would say for the last 3 days i have been getting diarrhea d ok ok so let us go back to the cough is it constant or is it triggered by certain things like the cold air dust you know certain times of the day like morning evening p i would say it is pretty pretty constant", "p since the last like 10 days it is there is no real pattern to it and i have mostly just been inside my house i do not think there are any triggers or i do not own any pets or anything like that no new rugs like no no new changes really in my house d ok ok and have you tried anything to make it better p no not really", "p i have done some home remedies like trying to do one of those steam steam masks and see if that helps but it did not really do anything d ok and how about the quality of that cough is it does it sound harsh p yeah i would say it is getting a little bit harsh it is more just like i am not bringing", "p anything up it is more like a dry cough but yeah i would say it is getting worse definitely d ok is it a dry cough then or are you producing a little bit of sputum or blood or anything like that p no no i have not seen any blood at all and rarely do i bring like up some sputum but like most of the time it is just a dry cough d ok", "d it is a dry cough and would you say the cough is getting worse p yeah i would definitely say in the last 3 to 4 days i have been just coughing nonstop it is very irritating d yeah have you experienced anything like this before p probably a few years ago i think i caught the flu or something and got really sick with a fever and just", "p a lot of coughing but since then nothing else d ok the shortness of breath one to 10 10 being the worst how bad is it p probably like a 5 it kind of just started out with 3 days ago was kind of like i just could not take deep breaths like i noticed that my breathing was getting a little bit more more shallow", "c and now it is especially when i am coughing it is like i really have to sit down and catch my breath d yeah does anything make the shortness of breath worse like i guess you know exertion laying down anything like that p not really maybe like sitting down helps sometimes", "p but even when i am sitting down i am still coughing d ok ok and do you have any wheeziness p no i do not think so d ok any chest pain p maybe from all the coughing sometimes i feel like there is some pain there but it is not not", "p anything that is too painful d ok do you feel like your heart is racing at all p no not really d ok have you noticed any swelling in your limbs p no i did not notice anything like that d ok how about pain in your calves when you walk a few blocks", "p no i have been fine that way d ok dizziness or fainting spells p no not really i i thought maybe with the shortness of breath that would happen but like so far that has not happened to me p ok any fevers or chills d no i maybe like a few chills like i am not sure actually it was hard to tell but i have not had any fevers p ok we will", "p take your temperature today just to make sure any weight loss over the past few weeks d no probably weight gain p ok any changes in your hair nails or skin like rashes p no i have not noticed anything like that d ok any changes in your vision or hearing p no no that that is all been", "p fine d how about loss of smell or taste p no i have not had i think my taste and smell are

swallowing food p no d no changes in your appetite p maybe just a little bit like i do not really feel like eating when i am coughing all the time but other than that no not really d ok how about nausea or vomiting p no nothing like", "p that d ok constipation p no diarrhea d diarrhea right how often are you having a bowel movement right now p i would say like i have been going probably more than 8 times a day probably in the last few days like 10 times a day d 0 wow ok and each time are you producing a lot", "d of stool or is it just a little bit each time p like a little bit but it is mostly liquidy d ok any solids at all like is it semi solid at all p maybe a little bit but mostly it is just liquid d ok any blood in the stool p no i have been checking no i did not notice any blood or change in color it is mainly", "p just liquid diarrhea d ok any changes in your urine p no d no ok any confusion or memory loss p no not that i know of d ok how about muscle aches or joint pains p no nothing like that d ok and are you otherwise healthy or do you have any long", "d standing medical conditions p so i do have diabetes and high blood pressure d ok do you take any medications for those conditions p yeah so for diabetes i am taking this medication called like i think metformin and then for the blood pressure i think it is i forgot the name i think it is something", "p like ramipril or something like that d yep ok and you are taking that as directed right p yeah i have been taking that regularly and my blood pressure i have been measuring it has been pretty steady no changes d ok that is good have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past p i did have my appendix removed probably in my 20s but that was the only", "p thing d ok and do you have any allergies p no not not really d ok are you up to date with all your immunizations p yep d ok are you on any other medications besides the ramipril and metformin p just like multi vitamins for men over 50 d ok", "d any family history of heart conditions or lung conditions that you know of p yeah so my family like diabetes is pretty big it runs in the family and my father in his 60s like died from a heart attack other than that not anything else i can think of no d ok any cancers", "d in their family p no i do not think so d ok do you smoke p i used to i i quit probably 5 years ago but before

her over the last week d ok well that is good and that is smart just because you do not know what you have right p mhmm d yeah ok do can you think of any other sick contacts that you may have had over the past one or 2 weeks or even 3 weeks p i go to the grocery store then i go to work i have not noticed anyone being sick at", "p but you know you never know like who comes in asymptomatic and like they might be carrying it with this virus like mainly i am worried about covid and you know just how fast that is spreading everywhere d yeah for sure yeah for sure have you traveled to anywhere recently p no we have been in canada ontario have not left to go", "p anywhere d ok ok well those are all the questions that i had for you did you have any questions or did you have any concerns anything that you wanted to discuss today p yeah no i just was wondering if i can get the covid test that would just i wanted to make sure i do not give anyone covid if i do have it d yeah for sure i think that is a good idea so and it is definitely something that we need to rule out", "d so we will do a covid swab today and you will hear back within 24 to 48 hours but in the mean time regardless of whether you actually have covid or not because your symptoms overlap with covid it is good to isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from your wife as well if possible and public health should be in touch if it is positive to do contact tracing and if it is not covid it is probably", "d another viral illness that is going around at this time of year if your symptoms get worse you know you are having neurological symptoms or or if your fever gets really high or you are having a lot of trouble breathing then you should go see the er how does that sound p my if my breathing gets worse i will just go to the emergency department d yes please do p ok sounds good", "p d alright take care p you too thank you", "p i was just bringing my son and he is just had cough for the last couple of days i thought about a day and a half ago it does not feel like a cold he has not been too sick but i was a little bit worried and i wanted to get him seen to see if there is anything we could do d yeah for sure it is a good thing that you brought him in so the cough is it consistent", "d or does it come and go p it seems to be a little bit worse at night he will have this cough during the day sometimes i will notice when he is playing he is had these coughing fits that last for up to a minute but usually recovers from he has not been too active to be honest he has been a little bit slowed down these last couple of days but in regards to consistency i would say it is a little bit worse at night d ok any other triggers like", "d dust or the cold air anything like that p i have not really noticed anything we have been mainly keeping inside due to covid right i think my wife left a window open the other night and maybe the cough was a little bit better i am not sure it is kind of hard to tell when we sleep d yeah have you tried anything for it like have you given him", "d any over the counter cough medications p no we are a little scared to give him anything he is so young he is 2 one 2 we have not been really giving him any medications to be honest d ok good and if you were to describe the quality of this cough would you say it is barky is it harsh p barky might be a good word to describe it like he is had colds before his coughs were quiet but this sounds", "p this sounds harsh it sounds like he is really trying to cough hard there very violent sometimes d ok ok and has he ever had a cough like this in the past p no never d ok and then in terms of the timeline is it getting worse his cough p i think it has been to be honest he was a little ill", "p he had a runny nose a couple of days ago maybe 2 days ago and then the cough started but it only really started getting noticeably different about the night of the 1st day about 2 days ago so

dry d ok so no blood as well right p no blood d ok does he have any shortness of breath with his cough p i feel like when he has the coughing fits he is winded he is weak after them sometimes he cries after them or before the middle can be a trigger for it but just resting", "p normally he does not seem that out of breath no d ok any wheeziness p no not really he is able to breathe i can not really hear him breathing that much sometimes at night after a bad cough he will be really winded and yeah it does sound like a little different when he is breathing but just right now he sounds normal d ok and", "d any reason for you to think he has chest pain p he has not any sort of chest pain he says his throat hurts but i do not think it is his chest d has he had any fevers p no d any change in his hair nails or skin like rashes p no no rashes d how about weight", "d loss p no weight loss he is a fairly healthy kid d and his vision and hearing are normal p you know i have not gotten him formally

it so it is hard to tell d ok so he has a little bit of a sore throat as well p yeah d ok ok and then any dizziness or fainting spells that you have noticed p no", "d p no fainting or dizzy spells but he is really gassed after he has like a coughing fit and he does not want to stand up he will just be sitting down or he wants to be held d ok is he more irritable than usual p yeah after he has a bad coughing fit he wants to be soothed and he will be crying but it is just more of because he is worn out i believe he is tired d yeah ok and then", "d any confusion or memory loss p no d ok and then in terms of his bowel movements have things been normal from that standpoint p 0 yeah process of potty training him but no no real changes d ok so no diarrhea no constipation no blood in the stool p no d ok and he is passing gas p ok yeah", "p i would say so d any nausea or vomiting p no we have not been really feeding him solid meals it is because he has been sick we have been trying to give him soup and liquids for the most part because his throat hurts but he is able to keep them down so no no nausea no vomiting d ok and then how about changes in his appetite p yeah he is not eating as much", "p we are trying to force food into him to keep his energy up most of time he always will be asking for snacks in the afternoon but now not so much d ok alright and any anything else that i missed that he has been experiencing over the past few days p no just the cough d ok and then", "d he otherwise healthy does he have any longstanding medical conditions p no longstanding medical conditions yeah nothing really we had a little bit of stay in the nicu just because he was a little bit underweight but no nothing really d ok and then his mother is pregnancy with him any complications at that point", "p yeah he is a little pre term 34 weeks i think d ok was he also underweight too you mentioned just a little bit p yeah d ok and any complications during the actual delivery p yeah not that i remember like she started going to labor early like earlier than we expected we thought it was just a regular contraction and that", "p resolve but she wound up proceeding when we showed up at the

questions for me p no no that is it no d ok well from the sounds of it he most likely has some sort of viral infection we will do a covid swap", "d to rule that out because some symptoms do seem to overlap with covid and we want to make sure to rule that out so we will take a swab those pcr results should come back in about 24 to 48 hours in the meantime he should isolate for 14 days at home and if it is not covid it could be another viral infection like parainfluenza", "d also known as croup so for that for any of these viral infections actually the best treatment is to stay at home and make sure that he is very well hydrated and eating well if his symptoms persist for 3 to 5 days or more or if his symptoms worsen especially if he has", "d like a seizure or urological issues he should go to the er and if his symptoms do become worse we can also prescribe him some steroids or epinephrine just to open up his airways and if it is really really bad he might be hospitalized as well so just keep an eye on on that for now", "d and if you have any questions or concerns just give us a call how does that sound p a little scary sounds good ok i will just keep an eye on him for the next 5 days d give us a call if his symptoms are becoming worse or if they are not resolving and we will try to do an assessment on him of course we will do a physical", "d exam today and will let you know how severe his symptoms are most children will get over their infection on their own and he likely will not need any additional treatments p ok sounds good d alright take care p thank you", "d so what

because sometimes these things can happen with an infection or after an infection and we just want to make sure that that is not you know what is happening right now we probably will do a covid swab just because of the times that we are living in right now but", "d i just want to ask you a few more questions before i go talk to the doctor so do you have besides your asthma do you have any health

covid we used to get together and have movie nights and play sports together d it sounds really cool hopefully we can get this figured out for you so you do not have any you do not have to use your your medications every time you play sports cause that is no fun and p no d you should be able to enjoy that so so we are going to try to get this sorted out for you i am going to go talk to the

consider could be possibly like vitamin deficiencies or things like that but i would be much much lower down on the differential and so to regain sensation i think", "d really the only thing that can be done now is to help prevent further damage to the nerves and that would be to make sure that the diabetes is under good control and trying to monitor your feet as regularly as you can making sure that the there are not any kind of open wounds or sores that are are not healing if things are not healing it will be important to check to see if there", "d is an underlying infection such as osteomyelitis which will prevent wound healing and so if there are any is anything like that it would be important to have that checked out so feet hygiene is extremely important as we are working on improving the diabetes control as well as things like cutting down alcohol", "d could also help as well p ok ok thank you", "p my back it just really hurts i feel really stiff in the morning and yeah

changes or any other symptoms it can also be since you have had a you were sick for months ago with a what might be gastroenteritis it can be sometimes a few months afterwards you can get something
