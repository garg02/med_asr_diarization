I actually thought maybe my asthma was getting worse over the past two three months. I didn't really. I just I didn't think too much of it. But then when I fainted, I was just kind of scared. \n\nD: Yeah, for sure. Umm, certainly would be frightening. OK, and do you use the inhaler everyday?\n\nP: No. I used to when I was young. I didn't have asthma for a couple of years for like, I'd say 20 years or so.

Mentioning that your heart was racing and so to rule out that any abnormal rhythms of your heart, or to check for that. And we will kind of go from there, did you have any questions? \n\nP: No.",
