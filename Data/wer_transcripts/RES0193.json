Was it during childhood?\n\nP: Yeah, she was younger. Um ever since I've known her, she said she's had she's had asthma. It hasn't had any like real I guess exacerbations that that I've noticed or been able to control her symptoms with with um inhalers.\n\nD: And um for him, how many times would you say he's having these episodes in an average week now?\n\nP: Uh I would say 2.\n\nD: 2 and is he getting Any of these symptoms at night time, like him waking up? \n\nP: He is yeah it's it. It is happening at night.\n\nD: OK, and then as he missed any days of school due to this? \n\nP: Yeah um. He's missed a couple of days in the past month because uh he just didn't sleep well and then not feeling good the next day. So um yeah, he has.\n\nD: OK. Yeah, so and any issues with the mother's pregnancy with him at all?\n\nP: No, she's healthy and the delivery was at term with a normal body weight or birth weight rather and he he was healthy when he was born.\n\nD: So no prolonged stay in the ICU or hospital after that?\n\nP: No, he was able to go home, luckily. \n\nD: OK, and afterwards has he been meeting all his milestones like his motor gross motor, fine motor, social skills and growth and all of those have been meeting them well.\n\nP: He has, yeah yeah. He's been meeting all of his milestones and growing well.\n\nD: OK, and um any at all issues from the school in terms of learning difficulties or anything like that?\n\nP: No, he's been doing well uh in school.\n\nD: OK, that's good. Um does he have any siblings?\n\nP: Um no, he's a it it's just him. He's our only child \n\nD: And what's the home situation like? Who does he live with?\n\nP: So it's myself and my wife, which his mom, and so it's just us three and we live in a um in a house.\n\nD: OK. Uh, and anyone in the household uh? Does anyone smoke at all?\n\nP: No, there aren't any smokers in the home.\n\nD: OK, and any new carpets or any dust running or mold or anything like that in the house?\n\nP: That there is a carpet and in the basement that, he uses that as his playroom, sometimes \n\nD: OK. OK. Yeah, so those are all the questions I had. Do you have any questions at all?\n\nP: Yeah, I was just wondering like if this could be maybe asthma as well?\n\nD: Yeah, so definitely. That's something that's at the top of our head right now, especially due to his age and the symptoms that he's been having after exertion in particular. And the family history of asthma as well. So definitely that's something that we want to investigate. So what we'll do for him is first, we'll do like a full physical examination. Listen to his alongs. And just assess his breathing and then afterwards we will order some tests for him, so he's six years old, right?\n\nP: He is yes.\n\n\nD: OK, so we'll see if we can do something called a pulmonary function test. Sometimes it depends on the child \nif they're able to follow instructions, and so that test requires a completely breathing out and following some instructions during the test. So since he's six, he might be able to do that. We we can try that. And then afterwards we'll see if he requires anything like an allergy testing or we will we might need to help manage his symptoms with a puffer, for example, like Ventilin and an  inhaled Cortico steroid, but those are just some discussions will have in the near future after we've done all these investigations.\n\nP: OK, great, thank you.\n\nD: You're welcome alright, take care \n\nP: Bye.\n\n",
