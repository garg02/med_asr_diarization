Any questions for me?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Okay, so yeah, there's definitely like the coughing and shortness of breath are definitely concerning, and they've been going on for a pretty long time. Do you ever have any night sweats or anything like that? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Okay. So there's a few things that we think about with the chronic shortness of breath and a cough. One could be just a COPD diagnosis with your long history of smoking. And this pulmonary function test, get an x-ray, chest x-ray as well. Um another thing that we need to look out for is uh, lung cancer. And since you have been smoking for a pretty long time, even though you may have quit, which is really great, but that long history of smoking, especially also with um, you working in a mine, those are some things that means we can test as well, and so we may require like a chest x-ray, and even um, a CT scan of your lungs as well. Um, so yeah, first we'll just do a couple tests, do a physical examination, get your vitals, do some blood work and do some of those tests and then we'll also get a COVID swab test done for you as well, just in case. Does that sound good?\n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: Alright, so we'll be with you shortly.\n",
