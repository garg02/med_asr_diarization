    "ref": "D: What brings you in?\n\nP: Hi, yes I just came in today because I've been a bit concerned about some breathing difficulties over the last few days. It all started out with like a cough over the last week, but now I'm having trouble breathing as well.\n\nD: Oh OK, well I'm sorry to hear that. So you said a cough as well, so the cough at least a week back and the shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, when did that start? \n\nP: So yeah, the cough, I usually have a cough. I've had COPD for a long time, but this past week the coughing has been much worse with a lot of more sputum and. Other than that, it started I would say two to three days ago. The cough got worse and then every time I'm moving around I like have to sit down and catch my breath, which is pretty abnormal for me.\n\nD: OK yeah, so alright. So let's focus on the cough first. You said it's a wet cough?\n\nP: Yes, I am producing a lot of sputum. \n\nD: OK, what color is your sputum?\n\nP: It's mainly like clear white.\n\nD: OK yeah so you don't see yellow pus or anything green or bloody in there?\n\nP: No, I don't think so. But there's definitely like a lot more than what I usually produce.\n\nD: OK, umm this cough, does it sound harsh, barky or does it sound muffled?\n\nP: I would say it's a bit harsh at times. I wouldn't say it's barky or muffled. I do find myself wheezing a little over the last few days as well. \n\nD: OK. Do you find you have any chest pain associated with the shortness of breath?\n\nP: Oh no, I don't really have any pains.\n\nD: OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this before?\n\nP: I did a couple of years ago, I had to be admitted because I had some shortness of breath. \n\nD: OK.\n\nP: But that was, I think, two years ago. \n\nD: OK. And when you were admitted two years ago, did they tell you what you had?\n\nP: Yeah, they said I had some kind of lung infection at that time, so they gave me some antibiotics while I was in the hospital.\n\nD: OK, did they ever say to you that you had anything else like asthma, COPD, any longstanding conditions?\n\nP: Yeah so I've had COPD for more than... I guess more than 10 years now so I think it just got a lot worse with the infection.\n\nD: OK yeah alright. So this time around, have you had any fevers?\n\nP: I've been having a couple of chills but like they would come and go. I didn't really think it was a fever.\n\nD: OK, any weight loss?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, how about changes in your hair or nails like or or skin like rashes? \n\nP: Umm, no. \n\nD: Any changes in your vision or hearing?\n\nP: Nope. \n\nD: And how about smell or taste?\n\nP: Umm, no. I think they're the same. \n\nD: OK. Have a stuffy nose or runny nose?\n\nP: I do feel a bit stuffy, but it's not too bad. \n\nD: OK. And any swelling in your in your legs or upper limbs?\n\nP: No, not that I know.\n\nD: How about calf pain? \n\nP: Nope.\n\nD: Dizziness or fainting spells?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Headaches?\n\nP: No headaches. \n\nD: Memory loss or confusion?\n\nP: Nope.\n\nD: Changes in your bowel movement or abdominal pain?\n\nP: Nope. \n\nD: Changes to urinating?\n\nP: No, that's all fine \n\nD: OK, so besides the COPD, do you have any other longstanding conditions?\n\nP: I do have some high blood pressure which I take, I think I take one of these medications called metoprolol. \n\nD: OK, and when was the last time you had your blood pressure checked?\n\nP: Umm, probably like a month ago and it was pretty good. I've been checking by myself at home too and it hasn't been changing too much. I think the last one I took was probably like 135 / 80.\n\nD: Oh, I see. OK, any hospitalizations besides the one that you had for COPD a year back?\n\nP: Umm, back when I was a kid I had my tonsils removed.\n\nD: OK, are you on any medications besides the metoprolol? \n\nP: I do take multivitamins.I think that's yeah, that's about it.\n\nD: Do you take any puffers for your COPD?\n\nP: Yeah, so I do have three like different puffers I take. I can't remember the name. I do have some puffers I don't take. I've been using them right now. It has been helping with some of my shortness of breath, but I've definitely been having to use them way more than I used to.\n\nD: OK. Do you know which puffer you're on?\n\nP: Yeah, so I think one of them is called ventolin. OK, and then I think the second one is called the Spiriva.\n\nD: OK, sure, Yep.\n\nP: So one of them should be a short acting beta agonist.\n\nD: Just wanna make sure that you have one with a long acting and then the other one is a long acting beta agonist. OK, good. Alright, are you up to date with all your immunizations?\n\nP: Yeah, I think so.\n\nD: And are you allergic to anything?\n\nP: No, not that I know.\n\nD: Any family history of lung conditions?\n\nP: Umm, no I don't think so. Yeah, no, I don't think so.\n\nD: OK. How about heart conditions?\n\nP: Yeah, my father died of a heart attack in his 60s. \n\nD: OK. Alright, any cancers?\n\nP: My uncle had skin cancer. \n\nD: OK. Do you know what type of skin cancer like melanoma, basal cell, squamous cell?\n\nP: No, I think it wasn't the bad one. It was like the one they can remove right away.\n\nD: Oh I see. OK, OK, that's good.Do you smoke?\n\nP: Yeah, I've been smoking for around, I would say the last 20 years.\n\nD: OK, how much do you smoke?\n\nP: Probably I would say pack a day for the last 20 years.\n\nD: Umm, have you ever thought about quitting?\n\nP: Yeah I did. I did once and then went back onto it. I definitely do smoke less than before though. OK, but yeah, I don't think I'm ready to quit yet.\n\nD: OK, yeah no problem. Do you drink alcohol? \n\nP: Umm, yeah, maybe once a week I would have a small Cup of whiskey.\n\nD: OK, sure, that's fine. And any other drugs?\n\nP: No, no marijuana, no other drugs.\n\nD: OK, and where do you live right now?\n\nP: Right now I live in a small bungalow in London. \n\nD: OK, any reasons to believe there are carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, anything that could be triggering your COPD?\n\nP: Umm, I don't think so. Everything is pretty up to date.\n\nD: OK, have you had any contact with anyone that's been sick recently?\n\nP: No, I've been mostly trying to isolate and like just be in my own home. \n\nD: OK, how about travel to anywhere?\n\nP: Nope, I've been in Ontario since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nD: Yeah OK, that makes sense. Well, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?\n\nP: Yeah, I was just worried if it can be COVID or if it's just like another infection that I had like before.\n\nD: Yeah, so we're definitely going to do a COVID swab on you and those results should take about 24 to 48 hours to come back to you. And in the meantime, because your symptoms do overlap with COVID, you should isolate for 14 days. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive to do some contact tracing. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's been going around during this time of year which is likely because you have COPD, since you're already coughing more than you usually are and seeing more sputum. We will reassess to see whether your puffers are working. If we need to add any additional things like inhaled corticosteroids as well as antibiotics and so just keep an eye on your symptoms for now and will also want to do probably a chest X Ray and possibly a pulmonary function test. How does that sound?\n\nP: Thank you. \n\nD: OK yeah no problem.",

breath 0 no i do not really have any pains ok and have you ever experienced anything like this before i did a couple of years ago i had to be admitted because i had some shortness of breath ok but that was i think 2 years ago ok and when you were admitted 2 years ago did they tell you what you had yeah they said i had some kind of lung infection at that time so they gave me some antibiotics while i was in the hospital ok did they ever say to you that you had anything else like asthma copd any longstanding conditions yeah so i have had copd for more than i guess more than 10 years now so i think it just got a lot worse with the infection ok yeah alright so this time around have you had any fevers i have been having a couple of chills but like they would come and go i did not really think it was a fever ok any weight loss no ok how about changes in your hair or nails like or or skin like rashes umm no any changes in your vision or hearing nope and how about smell or taste umm no i think they are the same ok have a stuffy nose or runny nose i do feel a bit stuffy but it is not too bad ok and any swelling in your in your legs or upper limbs no not that i know how about calf pain nope dizziness or fainting spells no headaches no headaches memory loss or confusion nope changes in your bowel movement or abdominal pain nope changes to urinating no that is all fine ok so besides the copd do you have any other longstanding conditions i do have some high blood pressure which i take i think i take one of these medications called metoprolol ok and when was the last time you had your blood pressure checked umm probably like a month ago and it was pretty good i have been checking by myself at home too and it has not been changing too much i think the last one i took was probably like 135 80 0 i see ok any hospitalizations besides the one that you had for copd a year back umm back when i was a kid i had my tonsils removed ok are you on any medications besides the metoprolol i do take multivitamins i think that is yeah that is about it do you take any puffers for your copd yeah so i do have 3 like different puffers i take i can not remember the name i do have some puffers i do not take i have been using them right now it has been helping with some of my shortness of breath but i have definitely been having to use them way more than i used to ok do you know which puffer you are on yeah so i think one of them is called ventolin ok and then i think the 2nd one is called the spiriva ok sure yep so one of them should be a short acting beta agonist just want to make sure that you have one with a long acting and then the other one is a long acting beta agonist ok good alright are you up to date with all your immunizations yeah i think so and are you allergic to anything no not that i know any family history of lung conditions umm no i do not think so yeah no i do not think so ok how about heart conditions yeah my father died of a heart attack in his 60s ok alright any cancers my uncle had skin cancer ok do you know what type of skin cancer like melanoma basal cell squamous cell no i think it was not the bad one it was like the one they can remove right away 0 i see ok ok that is good do you smoke yeah i have been smoking for around i would say the last 20 years ok how much do you smoke probably i would say pack a day for the last 20 years umm have you ever thought about quitting yeah i did i did once and then went back onto it i definitely do smoke less than before though ok but yeah i do not think i am ready to quit yet ok yeah no problem do you drink alcohol umm yeah maybe once a week i would have a small cup of whiskey ok sure that is fine and any other drugs no no marijuana no other drugs ok and where do you live right now right now i live in a small bungalow in london ok any reasons to believe there are carpets dust mold asbestos anything that could be triggering your copd umm i do not think so everything is pretty up to date ok have you had any contact with anyone that has been sick recently no i have been mostly trying to isolate and like just be in my own home ok how about travel to anywhere nope i have been in ontario since the beginning of the pandemic yeah ok that makes sense well those were all the questions that i had for you today did you have any questions of your own yeah i was just worried if it can be covid or if it is just like another infection that i had like before yeah so we are definitely going to do a covid swab on you and those results should take about 24 to 48 hours to come back to you and in the meantime because your symptoms do overlap with covid you should isolate for 14 days public health will be in touch with you if it is positive to do some contact tracing if it is not covid it could be another viral infection that has been going around during this time of year which is likely because you have copd since you are already coughing more than you usually are and seeing more sputum we will reassess to see whether your puffers are working if we need to add any additional things like inhaled corticosteroids as well as antibiotics and so just keep an eye on your symptoms for now and will also want to do probably a chest x ray and possibly a pulmonary function test how does that sound thank you ok yeah no problem",
