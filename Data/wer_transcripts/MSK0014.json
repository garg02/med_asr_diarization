And also I'm just a bit on the overweight side.\n\nD: OK, are you currently taking any medications?\n\nP: Yeah, so I am taking just um Furosemide then Ramipril for my blood pressure. But yeah, that's that's about it right now and like just painkillers over the counter.\n\nDL OK, uh. And any allergies to medications?\n\nP: Um, just to have a penicillin allergy.\n\nD: OK, and what's the rash, or sorry what's the reaction?\n\nP: I don't really remember I was a child at that time. I don't remember what reaction I really got.\n\nD: I see OK and have you had any prior hospitalizations or surgeries?\n\nP: Surgeries I did have my appendix removed when I was young and also I was hospitalized after my heart attack a couple years ago.\n\nD: OK, did you have any surgeries on your on your heart like a cabbage or?\n\nP: I had a couple a couple of stents put in.\n\nD: OK, and you take aspirin for that?\n\nP: Um yeah. \n\nD: OK. Uhm, Alright, and could you tell me a little bit about where you're living and who you're living with?\n\nP: Yeah, I live with my wife and daughter. And kind of live in a small little townhouse just, in the city.\n\nD: OK, uh, are you currently working or uh, are you retired?\n\nP: I I kind of had to retire after just my past medical history like the heart attack and then. There was just too much stress at work. It was too much for me. But yeah, I'm just at home right now. My wife still works. Yeah, I'm taking it more easy now.\n\nD: OK. And with being at home, are you able to manage the majority of activities of daily living on your own, or are you receiving help?\n\nP: Oh you're not receiving any outside help. I can do most things myself. My wife does most of our shopping and cooking though.\n\nD: OK. And do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: Yeah, I I do. I do drink probably drink like three or four beers a night.\n\nD: OK, Ann, and at the smoke cigarettes?\n\nP: I used to I I forced myself to quit after my heart attack.\n\nD: OK, well that's good. I'm glad that you quit and how long did you spoke for and how much were you smoking during that time?\n\nP: Probably smoked for more than 30 years and I was smoking only one to two packs a day at most. \n\nD: OK. And. OK, and then I about your um family history. Is there anybody in the family that has any heart or lung conditions?\n\nP: Yeah, so heart disease runs in my family. My brother, my dad, they both both have had heart attacks. But yeah, my on my mom side everyones pretty healthy though.\n\nD: Oh OK, that's good, and Alright, so I just wanted to the I guess physical exam piece you've already mentioned that it's red, it's swollen and is warm to touch compared to the other knee and um painful to move. Are you having any limping with your gait?\n\nP: Yeah, I barely like I can't really put too much away or move that knee around. So yeah, if I stood up I would have a limp.\n\nD: OK, uh, and is there any instability to either varus or valgus stress?\n\nP: Uhm, no, I don't think so.\n\nD: OK, and any instability when testing the ACL or PCL with the anterior and posterior kind of translation test. Pulling and pushing it?\n\nP: Uhm, no.\n\nD: OK. And any I don't think I asked this any muscle weakness?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: And any numbness, tingling?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Or burning sensations? \n\nP: No.\n\nD:  OK. Alright, so that was everything that I wanted to check. Was there any anything that I may be missed or any final questions?\n\nP: No, yeah no, I was just I I just don't know if like this is serious and if I need surgery or something because it's been really painful.\n\nD: Yeah, certainly so right now the top thing on top two things on the differential would be gout or pseudogout they do have some risk factors for that, including a diuretic medication as well as alcohol and obesity are all risk factors for it. However, you also had a knee injection a week ago, which could predispose to an infection. So gout and septic arthritis are the two things that I am thinking about an, so we'll do a knee aspiration and send that off for some investigations and that will help us determine which what the cause is and we can choose the appropriate appropriate treatment.\n\nP: OK, sounds good.\n",

    "ref_norm": "how may i help you i just came in here today i usually do not come to the doctor that much unless i absolutely need it 5 days ago i started having this pain and swelling in my right knee so and at 1st i thought it was just like my arthritis acting up but it has been getting more swollen and painful than usual so i just wanted to come in and check it out ok so when did you 1st notice that this pain like when did it get more swollen and painful than usual so like i would say around 5 days ago it started getting more and usually i do get pain in some of my joints but i i do not really get swelling so that was a bit different ok and is the joint hot as well or is there a temperature change it is it does feel like if i touch the joint it does feel a bit warmer than the surrounding areas ok does it look red it it definitely it definitely looks more red than my other knee ok and so what knee is it that that is bothering you right now it is the right knee ok and so this pain has been going on for the last 5 days has it been getting better worse or staying the same i think it is getting a it is getting it was getting worse but it is like a bit better right now ok yeah it comes and goes in severity though ok and how would you describe the the pain the character of it is it sharp dull or achy it is it is like someone is stabbing me in the knee and it hurts the most when i am moving the knee ok and does the pain radiate anywhere uhm i do not think so no ok so you are feeling it just in the knee and you said moving the knees is painful is there anything else that makes the pain worse uhm not really like resting it definitely helps yeah but i just have to keep it a bit immobilized ok and is there anything that that makes the pain better that you have tried like maybe medications or any ice packs or anything like that not really i do take some painkillers so just some advil which seems to help a little bit ok and and ok is the pain worse at any particular time of the day like do you have morning stiffness yeah usually with my normal this arthritis i do get some morning stiffness but this is completely different it is throughout the day pretty much ok and did you have any trauma or any injury to the knee no i did not ok i i did have like a steroid injection to the same knee just a week ago but no i i have not fallen on it i have not had any operations ok anne and have you had any fevers or chills no ok have you had any changes to any of your senses like vision hearing or your sense of smell or taste no nothing like that have you had a runny nose or sore throat no have you had any cough or shortness of breath no how about any wheezing nope have you had any chest pain or yeah have you had any chest pain no how about any lightheadedness or dizziness no ok and have you had any nausea or vomiting nope alright have you had any loss of appetite no and have you had any abdominal pain no have you had any changes to your bowel movements such as diarrhea or constipation incontinence no any urinary problems like painful urination or frequency no not really have you had any skin changes like rashes anywhere no ok and any other painful joints or muscle aches or body pains yeah i just got my general like i havee osteoarthritis so i like it has been a pretty long time though but i get some pain in my hips sometimes my knees so it is it is that has been going on for awhile but this is something i have never experienced though like this significant pain and swelling and redness ok and have you had any changes to your memory or any confusion nope ok and have you had any unexpected weight loss no and how about any night sweats no ok in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions i do have so i have a couple conditions i have osteoarthritis in both my knees and hips i have high blood pressure i did have a heart attack 4 years ago and i also have had heart failure and also i am just a bit on the overweight side ok are you currently taking any medications yeah so i am taking just furosemide then ramipril for my blood pressure but yeah that is that is about it right now and like just painkillers over the counter just to have a penicillin allergy ok and what is the rash or sorry what is the reaction i do not really remember i was a child at that time i do not remember what reaction i really got i see ok and have you had any prior hospitalizations or surgeries surgeries i did have my appendix removed when i was young and also i was hospitalized after my heart attack a couple years ago ok did you have any surgeries on your on your heart like a cabbage or i had a couple a couple of stents put in ok and you take aspirin for that yeah ok uhm alright and could you tell me a little bit about where you are living and who you are living with yeah i live with my wife and daughter and kind of live in a small little townhouse just in the city ok are you currently working or are you retired i i kind of had to retire after just my past medical history like the heart attack and then there was just too much stress at work it was too much for me but yeah i am just at home right now my wife still works yeah i am taking it more easy now ok and with being at home are you able to manage the majority of activities of daily living on your own or are you receiving help 0 you are not receiving any outside help i can do most things myself my wife does most of our shopping and cooking though ok and do you drink alcohol yeah i i do i do drink probably drink like 3 or 4 beers a night ok ann and at the smoke cigarettes i used to i i forced myself to quit after my heart attack ok well that is good i am glad that you quit and how long did you spoke for and how much were you smoking during that time probably smoked for more than 30 years and i was smoking only one to 2 packs a day at most ok and ok and then i about your family history is there anybody in the family that has any heart or lung conditions yeah so heart disease runs in my family my brother my dad they both both have had heart attacks but yeah my on my mom side everyones pretty healthy though 0 ok that is good and alright so i just wanted to the i guess physical exam piece you have already mentioned that it is red it is swollen and is warm to touch compared to the other knee and painful to move are you having any limping with your gait yeah i barely like i can not really put too much away or move that knee around so yeah if i stood up i would have a limp ok and is there any instability to either varus or valgus stress uhm no i do not think so ok and any instability when testing the acl or pcl with the anterior and posterior kind of translation test pulling and pushing it uhm no ok and any i do not think i asked this any muscle weakness no and any numbness tingling no or burning sensations no ok alright so that was everything that i wanted to check was there any anything that i may be missed or any final questions no yeah no i was just i i just do not know if like this is serious and if i need surgery or something because it has been really painful yeah certainly so right now the top thing on top 2 things on the differential would be gout or pseudogout they do have some risk factors for that including a diuretic medication as well as alcohol and obesity are all risk factors for it however you also had a knee injection a week ago which could predispose to an infection so gout and septic arthritis are the 2 things that i am thinking about an so we will do a knee aspiration and send that off for some investigations and that will help us determine which what the cause is and we can choose the appropriate appropriate treatment ok sounds good",
