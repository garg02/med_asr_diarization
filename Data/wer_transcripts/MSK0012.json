OK, so those are some of the questions I had. And I'm just gonna ask a few questions about just examining the areas that are giving you trouble. So along your back, if you if you were to press down on from the middle to your lower back, any kind of pain when you press down.\n\nP: Um lower back, yes.\n\nD: OK, So what kind of pain is it like sharp or is it kind of a dull aching pain?\n\nP: When I press down it feels sharp.\n\nD: OK, and do you have you notice any kind of swelling in your legs or, near the areas where you have pain swelling or redness, or  any warmth?\n\nP: Um it seems to. Actually, no, it's not. It's not warm.\n\nD: OK. And in terms of just movement, are you able to bend down?\n\nP: I can bend down, it's just hard for me to get back up.\n\nD: OK See and how about like bend sideways.\n\nP: I can do that.\n\nD: OK nd how about if you're laying flat are you able to raise your legs without bending your knees?\n\nP: I can do that, yeah, actually no. I can't. Sorry that that hurts.\n\nD: So your right leg hurts when you do that? \n\nP: Yeah\n\nD: OK, great.

Yeah.\n\nD: OK alright and when you stand up and walk how would you describe, are you having any kind of limping at all?\n\nP: Um a little bit of limp yeah,  I'm putting more weight on the left leg.\n\nD: OK, alright, so yeah, those are just some of the questions I I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all?\n\nP: Um no, what can I do about this back pain and how long do you think I'll have it for? \n\nD: Yeah, so it's been happening for one month right and you're getting some symptoms in in your lower leg, so normally we would wait before we do any kind of diagnostic imaging. But since you're also having these other symptoms we we were worrying about sometimes lower back pain can lead to something called sciatica. It's just when one of the nerves get pinched, and then that's why you're getting the tingling around your right upper leg. So what we can do is. We can do if you haven't had an X Ray, we can do an X Ray of your lower back. And then we can also do an MRI. \n\nP: OK \n\nD: And. Based on what results come back at the same time we will, I will give you some information about some anti- inflammatory medications you could take to help relieve some of your pain, but other than that I will also refer you to some physiotherapy. That will help you do some exercises at home. Just ways to protect your back as well as strengthen some of your muscles to help deal with some of that pain. Yeah, so we'll get the results back. And then we'll go from there.\n\nP: OK, sounds good. Thank you.\n \nD: You're welcome. Take care.\n\n",

    "ref_norm": "what brings you in here today i have had this pain in my back thats kind of like in my lower back and my buttocks and it is now radiating down to my right leg i have had this for awhile now but it is getting worse and i just want to come get it checked out ok and how long have you had this pain for about a month ok and has gone worse at all like did you have the it radiating through your leg before or is that something that happened after that is something that happened after that happens that that has been going on for the past week ok and is this pain constant or does it come and go and it is pretty much always there but certain things can make it worse like if i am walking or doing certain activities it can it can make it worse ok and did you have any back pain before this month no not i mean no not really ok an what kind of pain would you say it is is it like a sharp stabbing pain or is it more so a dull aching pain usually or well before it was like a mild achy pain but now it can be it is sharp and it feels like a burning sensation ok a burning sensation where would you say that burning sensation is it is like down my buttocks to the right leg ok and do you feel any kind of numbness or tingling with it a little a little bit of tingling yeah a little bit of tingling ok and how would you rate the pain from a scale of 0 to 10 10 being the worst pain you have had in your life so usually it is about like a 5 to 6 out of 10 but when it gets bad and sharp i would give it an 8 out of 10 ok and are there any kind of motions or positions that cause you more pain yeah so i would say like just any sort of physical activity like if i am on my feet a lot it hurts yeah that is pretty much the only thing that i can think of right now ok did anything happen one month ago or before this pain started like any injuries or falls that might have caused this pain no like a long time ago like 6 7 years ago i injured my back at work but i just did some conservative treatments for that and it went away ok was it your lower back yes ok and what do you do for work i used to work on an assembly line so i used to like carry heavy objects and things like that like car parts ok and do you still work there no i do not ok when did you stop working there about 3 years back ok and is there any other work you do currently i work from home now i do daycare at home ok ok and just getting back to the pain so it is kind of in your lower back your buttocks and then it goes to your right upper leg mmmm does it move anywhere else besides that or those are the regions that it stays in no those are kind of the only regions that i am experiencing it right now ok and do you get more pain leaning bending forward or would you say extending your back i would say ext extending my back hurts more ok and you get pain with sitting down sometimes ok how about lying down lying down i guess it depends on the position if i am straight on my back it is it is not too bad but if i like i am hunched over or something like that it hurts ok i see ok and have you tried any medications over the counter and painkillers that have helped i tried some ibuprofen and some like topical like ointments but it helps temporarily and then the pain comes back ok let us see and other than that so other than this pain that has been going on do you have any fevers or chills uhm no no fevers or chills ok no night sweats no any increased fatigue no no any rashes or skin changes no any any cough or cold symptoms recently no nothing like that ok and apart from your back any kind of joint or muscle pain anywhere else in your body no any changes in your bowel movements no ok any urinary problems nope any stool incontinence for your urinary incontinence no ok and any kind of numbness or paresthesia like around just your lower back and buttocks no no numbness just like that tingling burning feeling ok ok any recent weight changes like any significant weight loss no ok any muscle weakness at all in that area i am finding it hard to walk harder to walk ok are you limping at all yeah i am putting more weight on my left leg ok and do you feel so you mention you feel tingling going down your right leg do you feel any kind of numbness at all no no ok alright do you have any kind of urinary or fecal retention like at all no i am going i am using the washroom ok ok

questions i had and i am just going to ask a few questions about just examining the areas that are giving you trouble so along your back if you if you were to press down on from the middle to your lower back any kind of pain when you press down lower back yes ok so what kind of pain is it like sharp or is it kind of a dull aching pain when i press down it feels sharp ok and do you have you

and how long do you think i will have it for yeah so it has been happening for one month right and you are getting some symptoms in in your lower leg so normally we would wait before we do any kind of diagnostic imaging but since you are also having these other symptoms we we were worrying about sometimes lower back pain can lead to something called sciatica it is just when one of the nerves get pinched and then that is why you are getting the tingling around your right upper leg so what we can do is we can do if you have not had an x ray we can do an x ray of your lower back and then we can also do an mri ok and based on what results come back at the same time we will i will give you some information about some anti inflammatory medications you could take to help relieve some of your pain but other than that i will also refer you to some physiotherapy that will help you do some exercises at home just ways to protect your back as well as strengthen some of your muscles to help deal with some of that pain yeah so we will get the results back and then we will go from there ok sounds good thank you you are welcome take care",
