Anything in particular that you're doing that makes it worse?\n\nP: Uhm, not really, it's kind of, I just feel like, it's just more difficult to breathe, uh, most of the time. \n\nD: And, has this happened to you before?\n\nP: Uhm, not like, no, nothing like this has happened before. \n\nD: OK, do you have a history of any lung problems?\n\nP: No, I don't, I've been healthy.\n\nD: So no COPD, no asthma, nothing like that,  right?\n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, so you're just having difficulties breathing for the past three-four days.

It feels pretty sharp when it happens and it goes away after a few minutes.\n\nD: OK, and where exactly is it, is the pain?\n\nP: Uh yeah, I kind of feel it, Yeah, just over on the right side of the sternum. \n\nD: OK. Alright, and does it radiate anywhere? Does it go anywhere other than that one location?\n\nP: No, I feel it just in the one spot.\n\nD: OK, uhm, and has that pain gotten worse overtime?\n\nP: No, that pain started, I guess like two days ago. More recent than the cough or shortness of breath.\n\nD: I see, I see, OK. And so you said that coughing makes it worse and sometimes breathing in. So is it just normal breathing or when you're doing like, deep breathing?\n\nP: Deep breathing. \n\nD: Deep breathing hurts? OK. Alright, and you've never experienced this before, right?\n\nP: No, I haven't had a pain like this before.\n\nD: OK, when you sort of touch that area over your chest, does touching it make it worse?\n\nP: Uhm, no, I haven't noticed that, touching it doesn't make it worse.\n\nD: OK. Uhm, alright, have you had a headache? \n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: No, OK. What about fatigue or muscle aches?\n\nP: I've been fatigued.

I don't have a thermometer at home.\n\nD: Yeah, no problem and your throat's been a little bit itchy and then two days ago you also started having this pain in your chest. Is there any other symptom that I have not mentioned that you have been experiencing over the past couple of days?\n\nP: No, that's everything. \n\nD: Yeah, OK. And you mentioned that you don't have a history of asthma or COPD. Do you have any other medical conditions?\n\nP: I have high blood pressure. And I take Amlodipine, for that.\n\nD: OK any other over the counter medications or any other medication that you're on?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any allergies?\n\nP: No allergies.\n\nD: OK, and where do you currently live?\n\nP: In a townhouse just outside of the city here.\n\nD: I see, do you live alone?\n\nP: No, I live with my wife and daughter.\n\nD: And have your wife and daughter been sick recently or have either of you had contact with someone who's been sick?\n\nP: I've been working from home, uhm, but my daughter has recently started going back to high school and she's had a runny nose recently and a sore throat, but that's about it.\n\nD: And what about your wife?\n\nP: She's been fine. Yeah, she's been healthy.\n\nD: OK, good. Other than your daughter, have you been in contact with anyone else who might have, who might be sick or might have symptoms similar to what your daughter has?\n\nP: I don't think so. \n\nD: OK, alright, and do you, have you traveled anywhere recently?\n\nP: No, I've been just, uh, working from home.\n\nD: OK, and do you smoke? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Ever smoked in the past?\n\nP: No, I've never smoked before.\n\nD: Marijuana?\n\nP: I mean, I'll have a joint sometimes with friends at a party or something, but that's maybe once a month?\n\nD: Sure, and any street drugs?\n\nP: Nope, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, and do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: I have a beer a couple of times per week.\n\nD: Alright, and you told me about your medical history, but do you have, have you ever had any surgeries or any hospitalizations in the past?\n\nP: Uh, I've had a hernia repair, about seven years ago.
