    "ref": "D: I was wondering if you could tell us what brought you in to see us.\n\nP: Yeah, so I just came in. I was a bit worried because I've been having this cough for around two years, which has been getting worse. But recently I've noticed that I see streaks of blood in the sputum that I'm producing. Before it just used to be like white but now I'm seeing over the last, I would say two months occasionally some streaks of blood.\n\nD: OK, and the cough started two years ago.\n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: OK. And, it's been gradually getting worse over that time?\n\nP: Yeah, I would say so. It's getting more frequent and worse in nature.\n\nD: OK. And how much sputum are you bringing up an in a day?\n\nP: Probably like a, a couple teaspoons. \n\nD: OK, and uh, is are you seeing like bright red blood when you're when you're coughing it up?\n\nP: Uh. In this it's kind of mixed into the sputum. I would say like, but it definitely is red.\n\nD: OK. And how much blood would you say that you're you're bringing up would be teaspoons? Or a Cup? Or?\n\nP: No. It's just like a little streaks. It's not really significant, it doesn't feel like the whole production of the sputum, but just like little streaks that I've noticed.\n\nD: OK and um is the cough worse, at any particular time of day?\n\nP: Um, it definitely gets worse when I'm doing more activities and then also when I get like some viral infections. But other than that, it's pretty much always there. \n\nD: OK, anything that that makes it worse? You said some viral infections. Have you had a viral infection recently?\n\nP: Yeah, like in the last two years, I've probably had two or three viral infections, just just just cold cold symptoms.\n\nD: Has there been anything that you've tried to make the cough better?\n\nP: I've tried the Tylenol Cold, hasn't really worked. Tried just other over the counter medications, haven't really worked. \n\nD: OK. And prior to two years ago um, were you experiencing any similar symptoms like, uh, like this cough or bringing up blood before? \n\nP: In the past, I've always had a somewhat of a cough like I have COPD. So I've always had a little bit of a cough here and there, but over the last two years I feel that it's been getting much worse. \n\nD: OK, have you been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis before?\n\nP: Yeah I think so.\n\nD: OK. Um and so with with this cough and now blood tinged sputum, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?\n\nP: Um, I do feel sometimes I get like more tired than I used to throughout the day.\n\nD: OK.\n\nP: Um, sometimes I also feel more breathless on when I'm exerting myself more.\n\nD: OK, and have you been having any fevers or chills?\n\nP: No, no I haven't.\n\nD: How about any night sweats?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Have you lost any weight?\n\nP: Yeah, I've actually lost a significant amount of weight. I would say within the last 1 and a 1/2 months probably lost like 8 to 10 pounds. \n\nD: OK, have you been trying to lose weight?\n\nP: No, not really I've just been sitting around like I can barely walk that much anymore too. I used to be able to walk at least 400 meters around the block, but now I can barely even go to the kitchen. \n\nD: OK, is this because of the shortness of breath when you are are exerting? \n\nP: Yeah, that and I just start coughing so much that I just have to sit down.\n\nD: OK. Um, and have you been having any headaches?\n\nP: No headaches.\n\nD: Alright, and how about and how is your appetite been?\n\nP: Um, I think it's been pretty much the same. Sometimes when I'm coughing a lot, I don't feel like eating, but other than that it's been around the same.\n\nD: OK, any nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Any runny nose or sore throat?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK. And then how about a loss of smell or a loss of taste? \n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, have you been having any chest pain?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Any heart palpitations? \n\nP: Nope.\n\nD: Any wheezing when you're breathing?\n\nP: Sometimes I would say like when when, it gets worse when I'm exerting myself more, I I can get some wheezing. \n\nD: OK, and have you noticed any swelling in your feet or ankles?\n\nP: No, nothing like that. \n\nD: Alright. And have you woken up at night extremely short of breath?\n\nP: No, I'm pretty fine during the night. \n\nD: Alright And, uh, have you been having any abdominal pain?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any urinary problems?\n\nP: Uh no. \n\nD: Any bowel problems like diarrhea or constipation?\n\nP: No, nothing like that. \n\nD: Alright, any skin rashes?\n\nP: Nope.\n\nD: Any joint pains or or muscle pains?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any weakness?\n\nP: Not weakness, I'll just say more fatigue. \n\nD: Alright so I know you told me a COPD, but do you have any other medical diagnosis? \n\nP: Yeah, I have high blood pressure as well. \n\nD: Alright.\n\nP: I think I have high cholesterol too.\n\nD: I see, OK. Do you take any medications regularly?\n\nP: Yeah, so for the cholesterol taking Rosuvastatin and I forget what I'm taking for the blood pressure, but it's pretty well under control.\n\nD: OK, do you use any inhalers for COPD?\n\nP: I used to. I used to have I think like 3 different inhalers but haven't had to use them for more than 10 years now.\n\nD: OK, and what was the reason for not needing them anymore? \n\nP: I just didn't have any symptoms for a pretty long time and my doc said like if I don't really need them then I could just stop.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any recent hospitalizations? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any allergies to medications?\n\nP: Nope. \n\nD: Any surgeries that you had in the past?\n\nP: No surgeries. \n\nD: OK, And are your vaccinations up to date?\n\nP: Yup. \n\nD: OK, and could you tell me a little bit about your social situation or living situation?\n\nP: Yeah, so currently I'm just living by myself in an apartment. I've been there for more than 10 years now. Um, I am retired so I'm not working anymore. But yeah, that's that's me.\n\nD: OK, great um. What did you do previously for for work? Did you have any exposures for two chemicals or dusts or asbestos? Things like of that nature?\n\nP: Oh yes, I worked in the steel factory for most of my working life. I think yeah, there might have been some exposures to chemicals and dust particles. Asbestos I don't think there was exposure, but definitely I may have lived in places that had asbestos. I mean, yeah.\n\nD: OK, how long have you been living where you you've been now?\n\nP: So this this is like the one I'm living in is a new place, but before that, I lived in another apartment for around five years and that was a pretty old building.\n\nD: OK, do you have any pets?\n\nP: No pets, no.\n\nD: OK um. And do you smoke cigarettes?\n\nP: Yeah, I smoke, I'd say around 20 cigarettes a day right now.\n\nD: Alright, and did you smoke more previously?\n\nP: Yeah, I think I've been smoking for almost like 40 years now and I used to smoke up to 30 cigarettes a day. \n\nD: OK, do you smoke cannabis?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Alright. Do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: Um just maybe a couple times a month. Nothing, nothing throughout the week.\n\nD: OK, so do you use any recreational drugs like IV drugs or opioids or cocaine? \n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: Alright. And anybody in the family have any similar symptoms before like coughing up blood or?\n\nP: No. Not that I know of. My father passed away from a heart attack when he was in his 60s. And I think my mother had a, um like I think one of the like, an arthritis. But yeah, like, but I think that was just like the one that you get with old age.\n\nD: OK, like osteoarthritis? \n\nP: Yeah that that was the one.\n\nD: OK. Any cancers in the family?\n\nP: Um, not that, one of my uncles had like um bladder cancer, but that's that's that's about it.\n\nD: OK, and have you have you traveled anywhere recently or been around any sick contacts? Possibly people anybody who's had tuberculosis or any infections?\n\nP: No, I've been pretty much to myself over the last few months, so not really.\n\nD: OK um. Was there anything that you're worried that this could be?\n\nP: Um Yeah, just the blood I kind of got scared maybe I thought like you know what if it's a cancer? One of my friends had lung cancer and I I know I've been smoking for most of my life, so that's something I was worried about.\n\nD: Um, I can certainly see that the concern and I understand where you're coming from. I think it would be very reasonable to investigate that today. So we'll start with a chest CT along with some lab work and we will get a CBC and some electrolytes, also get an ECG as well to just check your heart and we will see what what the investigations show\n\nP: Sounds good. \n\nD: OK, and um, other things that um to think about this could be, uh, also like to COPD I know it's been going on a long time, but possibly could have a pneumonia that's been lingering on, particularly if it's a fungal type of infection and as well as things like you mentioned you possibly unsure if you've had an asbestos exposure in the past and stuff like that can possibly lead to scarring of the lung, and so all of these factors will be looked into.\n\nP: OK, sounds good. Thank you so much. \n\nD: Alright, you're welcome, thank you.\n\n",

    "pred_norm_p": "yeah so i just came in i was a bit worried because i have been having this cough for around 2 years which has been getting worse but recently i have noticed that i see streaks of blood in the sputum that i am producing before it just used to be like white but now i am seeing over the last i would say 2 months occasionally some streaks of blood yeah yeah i would say so it is getting more frequent and worse in nature probably like a couple teaspoons it is kind of mixed into the sputum i would say but it definitely is red no it is just like little streaks it is not really significant it does not feel like the whole production of the sputum but just like little streaks that i have noticed it definitely gets worse when i am doing more activities and then also when i get like some viral infections but other than that it is pretty much always there yeah like in the 2 or 3 viral infections just colds cold symptoms i have tried the tylenol cold it has not really worked i have tried just other over the counter medications they have not really worked before in the little bit of a cough here and there but over the last 2 years i feel that it has been getting much worse yeah i think so more tired than i used to throughout the day sometimes i also feel more breathless when i am exerting myself more no no i have not no yeah i have actually lost a significant amount of weight i would say within the last one.5 month i have probably lost like 8 to \u00a310 no not really i have just been sitting around like i can barely walk that much anymore too i used to be able to walk at least 400 meters around the block but now i can barely even go to the kitchen yeah that and i just start coughing so much that i just have to sit down no headaches i think it has been pretty much the same sometimes when i am coughing a lot i do not feel like eating but other than that it has been around the same no no no nothing like that nope nope sometimes i would say like when it gets worse when i am exerting myself more i can get some wheezing no nothing like that no i am pretty fine during the night nope nope no nothing like that nope nope not weakness i would just say more fatigue yeah i have high blood pressure as well and i think i have high cholesterol too yeah so for the cholesterol i am taking rosuvastatin and i forget what i am taking for the blood pressure but it is pretty well under control i think like 3 different inhalers but i have not had to use them for i would say more than 10 years now i just did not have any symptoms for a pretty long time and my doc said like if i do not really need them then i can just stop no nope no surgeries yep yeah so currently i am just living by myself in an apartment i have been there for more than 10 years now i am retired so i am not working anymore but yeah that is me yeah so i worked in the steel factory for most of my working life i think yeah there might have been some exposures to chemicals and just dust particles asbestos i do not think there was exposure but definitely i may have lived in places that had asbestos so this is like the one i am living in as a new place but before that i lived in another apartment for around 5 years and that was a pretty old building no pets no yeah i smoke i would say around 20 cigarettes a day right now yeah i think i have been smoking for almost like 40 years now and i used to smoke up to 30 cigarettes a day no just maybe a couple times a month nothing throughout the week no nothing like that no not that i know of my father passed away from a heart attack when he was in his 60s and i think my mother had like i think one of the like an arthritis yeah like but i think that was just like the one that you get with old age yeah that was the one not that i know of one of my uncles had like bladder cancer but that is about it no i have been pretty much to nothing yeah just the blood i kind of got scared or maybe i thought like you know what if it is a cancer one of my friends had lung cancer and i know i have been smoking for most of my life so that is something i was worried about sounds good okay sounds good thank you so much",
    "ref_norm": "i was wondering if you could tell us what brought you in to see us yeah so i just came in i was a bit worried because i have been having this cough for around 2 years which has been getting worse but recently i have noticed that i see streaks of blood in the sputum that i am producing before it just used to be like white but now i am seeing over the last i would say 2 months occasionally some streaks of blood ok and the cough started 2 years ago yeah ok and it has been gradually getting worse over that time yeah i would say so it is getting more frequent and worse in nature ok and how much sputum are you bringing up an in a day probably like a a couple teaspoons ok and is are you seeing like bright red blood when you are when you are coughing it up in this it is kind of mixed into the sputum i would say like but it definitely is red ok and how much blood would you say that you are you are bringing up would be teaspoons or a cup or no it is just like a little streaks it is not really significant it does not feel like the whole production of the sputum but just like little streaks that i have noticed ok and is the cough worse at any particular time of day it definitely gets worse when i am doing more activities and then also when i get like some viral infections but other than that it is pretty much always there ok anything that that makes it worse you said some viral infections have you had a viral infection recently yeah like in the last 2 years i have probably had 2 or 3 viral infections just just just cold cold symptoms has there been anything that you have tried to make the cough better i have tried the tylenol cold has not really worked tried just other over the counter medications have not really worked ok and prior to 2 years ago were you experiencing any similar symptoms like like this cough or bringing up blood before in the past i have always had a somewhat of a cough like i have copd so i have always had a little bit of a cough here and there but over the last 2 years i feel that it has been getting much worse ok have you been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis before yeah i think so ok and so with with this cough and now blood tinged sputum have you been experiencing any other symptoms i do feel sometimes i get like more tired than i used to throughout the day ok sometimes i also feel more breathless on when i am exerting myself more ok and have you been having any fevers or chills no no i have not how about any night sweats no have you lost any weight yeah i have actually lost a significant amount of weight i would say within the last one and a one 2 months probably lost like 8 to \u00a310 ok have you been trying to lose weight no not really i have just been sitting around like i can barely walk that much anymore too i used to be able to walk at least 400 meters around the block but now i can barely even go to the kitchen ok is this because of the shortness of breath when you are are exerting yeah that and i just start coughing so much that i just have to sit down ok and have you been having any headaches no headaches alright and how about and how is your appetite been i think it has been pretty much the same sometimes when i am coughing a lot i do not feel like eating but other than that it has been around the same ok any nausea or vomiting no any runny nose or sore throat no ok and then how about a loss of smell or a loss of taste no nothing like that ok have you been having any chest pain no any heart palpitations nope any wheezing when you are breathing sometimes i would say like when when it gets worse when i am exerting myself more i i can get some wheezing ok and have you noticed any swelling in your feet or ankles no nothing like that alright and have you woken up at night extremely short of breath no i am pretty fine during the night alright and have you been having any abdominal pain no any urinary problems no any bowel problems like diarrhea or constipation no nothing like that alright any skin rashes nope any joint pains or or muscle pains no any weakness not weakness i will just say more fatigue alright so i know you told me a copd but do you have any other medical diagnosis yeah i have high blood pressure as well alright i think i have high cholesterol too i see ok do you take any medications regularly yeah so for the cholesterol taking rosuvastatin and i forget what i am taking for the blood pressure but it is pretty well under control ok do you use any inhalers for copd i used to i used to have i think like 3 different inhalers but have not had to use them for more than 10 years now ok and what was the reason for not needing them anymore i just did not have any symptoms for a pretty long time and my doc said like if i do not really need them then i could just stop ok and have you had any recent hospitalizations no any allergies to medications nope any surgeries that you had in the past no surgeries ok and are your vaccinations up to date yup ok and could you tell me a little bit about your social situation or living situation yeah so currently i am just living by myself in an apartment i have been there for more than 10 years now i am retired so i am not working anymore but yeah that is that is me ok great what did you do previously for for work did you have any exposures for 2 chemicals or dusts or asbestos things like of that nature 0 yes i worked in the steel factory for most of my working life i think yeah there might have been some exposures to chemicals and dust particles asbestos i do not think there was exposure but definitely i may have lived in places that had asbestos i mean yeah ok how long have you been living where you you have been now so this this is like the one i am living in is a new place but before that i lived in another apartment for around 5 years and that was a pretty old building ok do you have any pets no pets no ok and do you smoke cigarettes yeah i smoke i would say around 20 cigarettes a day right now alright and did you smoke more previously yeah i think i have been smoking for almost like 40 years now and i used to smoke up to 30 cigarettes a day ok do you smoke cannabis no alright do you drink alcohol just maybe a couple times a month nothing nothing throughout the week ok so do you use any recreational drugs like iv drugs or opioids or cocaine no nothing like that alright and anybody in the family have any similar symptoms before like coughing up blood or no not that i know of my father passed away from a heart attack when he was in his 60s and i think my mother had a like i think one of the like an arthritis but yeah like but i think that was just like the one that you get with old age ok like osteoarthritis yeah that that was the one ok any cancers in the family not that one of my uncles had like bladder cancer but that is that is that is about it ok and have you have you traveled anywhere recently or been around any sick contacts possibly people anybody who is had tuberculosis or any infections no i have been pretty much to myself over the last few months so not really ok was there anything that you are worried that this could be yeah just the blood i kind of got scared maybe i thought like you know what if it is a cancer one of my friends had lung cancer and i i know i have been smoking for most of my life so that is something i was worried about i can certainly see that the concern and i understand where you are coming from i think it would be very reasonable to investigate that today so we will start with a chest ct along with some lab work and we will get a cbc and some electrolytes also get an ecg as well to just check your heart and we will see what what the investigations show sounds good ok and other things that to think about this could be also like to copd i know it has been going on a long time but possibly could have a pneumonia that has been lingering on particularly if it is a fungal type of infection and as well as things like you mentioned you possibly unsure if you have had an asbestos exposure in the past and stuff like that can possibly lead to scarring of the lung and so all of these factors will be looked into ok sounds good thank you so much alright you are welcome thank you",
