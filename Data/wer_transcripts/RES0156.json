So yeah, just under a year.\n\nD: OK um, has she been diagnosed at all with any medical conditions in the past?\n\nP: Um, no, no, and when she was born she had to uh go in the, just be observed for a few um a couple of days for jaundice. She didn't need to have any therapy for it, it went away on its own, but that's about it. \n\nD: OK, and any um complications during the pregnancy with her?\n\nP: No, everything was was normal and it was a vaginal delivery at at term.\n\nD: OK, um any issues with the development, uh is she meeting her milestones in her growth, um meeting her milestones on her growth chart as well? \n\nP: Yeah, all of that has been has been normal.\n\nD: OK, um any allergies to medications or environmental factors that you know of?\n\nP: Not to um any medications that I'm aware of, but um she hasn't been tested, but she does get symptoms that uh kind of change with um seasons, like she'll get a runny nose and some itchy eyes um at different times throughout the year.\n\nD: OK.

It seems that she gets them on exertion and um they're worsened by exertion. Um at this age, one thing that definitely we want to check is if she has asthma. Um she does have some other symptoms that um are associated with asthma, like it seems that she gets um, some irritation through environmental factors as well. So what we'll do uh for her is get something called a pulmonary function test for her to see, that'll test if she in fact has asthma or not, and then based on that we will uh see if she needs any puffers. Um that can help relieve some of her symptoms. Uh and lastly, since she's having a cough, we'll also do a like a Covid test just in case as well.\n\nP: OK, yeah that that sounds good. Thank you.\n\nD: Yeah, and no worries, and then we'll also do like a full physical examination.\n\nP: That sounds great.\n\nD: Alright. ",
