And can you tell me a little bit about the living situation currently like who is the primary caregiver for her and like who she who she's living with then whereabouts?\n\nP: And she's living with both her parents and myself as well as her dad. And she has a 7 year old brother and we live in a house just outside of London.\n\nD: I see OK and is she going to daycare right now or anything like that?\n\nP: Umm no she's she's at home with me.\n\nD: OK, she been around anybody who's been sick, \n\nP: No.\n\nD: And have you traveled anywhere?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, an any concern for like physical or emotional violence in the home?\n\nP: No nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, and is there anybody who smokes in the home?\n\nP: Uhm no, no one smokes at home.\n\nD: OK.

And so the elbows look fine, neither elbow appears red or swollen.\n\nD: OK, and. Are you seeing any muscle atrophy or any joint deformity or or malalignment?\n\nP: No, I don't see that. I also actually it might be slightly. It looks a little bit awkward the way she's holding it, so I can't tell if it's misaligned.\n\nD: OK, and any skin changes over the elbow?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Alright Ann. If you were to press over various portions of the elbow, are there any areas that cause pain like the lateral side, medial side, or anterior posterior?\n\nP: It hurts she's in pain whenever I touch anywhere near the elbow area. \n\nD: OK, and um is there any pain with with movement?\n\nP: Yes. Whenever I tried to bend it or straighten it out all the way she she complaints of pain.\n\nD: OK, how about moving the rest or shoulder?\n\nP: No, that's fine.\n\nD: OK, so that that was everything that I wanted to ask about and and look for on the physical today. Did you have anything else that perhaps I forgot to mention that might be important?\n\nP: Uhm no that was kind of it, I just was wondering how we can fix her elbow.\n\nD: I yeah certainly so. It will be so when I get an elbow X Ray. And. But typically to fix this type of injury, so currently I'm thinking this could be a like a radial head subluxation, and possibly a radial head fracture, but most likely I radial head subluxation, where there's a mechanism of pulling on a child's arm. And it's just that the what could happen is the part of the radius, which is that a forearm bone can pull out of the ligament that's holding it down.\n\nP: OK.\n\nD: An just because of the structures there, not yet fully matured and strong, and somebody who's that young. And so it will cause pain reduced range of motion at the elbow and you won't really see much swelling or redness, and with just the physical exam maneuver you can reduce it and then put the head of the radius back into place and things will be usually back to back to normal. But if there is a fracture which will look for an X-Ray then there the pain might be last a little bit longer, but immobilization of the arm is not required and most kids will regain full mobility in in a short time after the reduction.\n\nP: OK, that sounds good, thank you.\n",

hospitalized for any reason or has she had any surgeries no ok any concerns for reaching developmental milestones such as walking talking and like social interactions no no issues there no problems yeah ok and then how about like just growth and and development is she getting taller and i am gaining weight yeah like that has been pretty good ok well that is good and were there any concerns with the pregnancy with her any like gestational diabetes high blood pressure or infections no everything went smoothly ok was she at term or where she pre term she was at term she was like a 37 one 2 weeks or something like that ok and was it vaginal delivery or c section it was vaginal ok and was there any reason for her to stay in hospital afterwards no ok and can you tell me a little bit about the living situation currently like who is the primary caregiver for her and like who she who she is living with then whereabouts and she is living with both her parents and myself as well as her dad and she has a 7 year old brother and we live in a house just outside of london i see ok and is she going to daycare right now or anything like that umm no she is she is at home with me ok she been around anybody who has been sick no and have you traveled anywhere no ok an any concern for like physical or emotional violence in the home no nothing like that ok and is there anybody who smokes in the home uhm no no one smokes at home ok and are there any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions that run in the family uhm no how about any heart or lung conditions no ok so i ask you to just have a look at her elbow now and sure let me know the if you are seeing any swelling or redness ok and so the elbows look fine neither elbow appears red or swollen ok and are you seeing any muscle atrophy or any joint deformity or or malalignment no i do not see that i also actually it might be slightly it looks a little bit awkward the way she is holding it so i can not tell if it is misaligned ok and any skin changes over the elbow no alright ann if you were to press over various portions of the elbow are there any areas that cause pain like the lateral side medial side or anterior posterior it hurts she is in pain whenever i touch anywhere near the elbow area ok and is there any pain with with movement yes whenever i tried to bend it or straighten it out all the way she she complaints of pain ok how about moving the rest or shoulder no that is fine ok so that that was everything that i wanted to ask about and and look for on the physical today did you have anything else that perhaps i forgot to mention that might be important uhm no that was kind of it i just was wondering how we can fix her elbow i yeah certainly so it will be so when i get an elbow x ray and but typically to fix this type of injury so currently i am thinking this could be a like a radial head subluxation and possibly a radial head fracture but most likely i radial head subluxation where there is a mechanism of pulling on a child is arm and it is just that the what could happen is the part of the radius which is that a forearm bone can pull out of the ligament that is holding it down ok an just because of the structures there not yet fully matured and strong and somebody who is that young and so it will cause pain reduced range of motion at the elbow and you will not really see much swelling or redness and with just the physical exam maneuver you can reduce it and then put the head of the radius back into place and things will be usually back to back to normal but if there is a fracture which will look for an x ray then there the pain might be last a little bit longer but immobilization of the arm is not required and most kids will regain full mobility in in a short time after the reduction ok that sounds good thank you",
