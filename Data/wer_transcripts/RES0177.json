Any blood in there?\n\nP: No, I haven't noticed any any blood.\n\nD: OK, and does he seem short of breath or wheezy? \n\nP: No wheezing, but he does have some shortness of breath.\n\nD: OK. And the service of bread started with a cough?\n\nP: Ii did, yeah.\n\nD: OK. Uhm, how much shortness of breath is he having? Is it just when he's exerting himself or is it at rest as well?\n\nP: I'd say ah, even at rest now he's like breathing faster.\n\nD: OK, umm, and it does anything help with that? So does sitting up help? Or, uh, you know, getting fresh air or anything like that?\n\nP: No. But you'd say, like taking a smaller breaths helps because like if he if he takes a deep breath and he gets, he gets like chest pain. \n\nD: OK, OK, and how about when he's laying down?\n\nP: No, he hasn't said anything like, like that for laying down just I think when he's just taking a deep breath, he said.\n\nD: OK, is it waking him up from sleep?\n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: No, OK. How about chest pain?\n\nP: Yeah, so yeah he's had some pain when he, when he just really takes that deep breath in.\n\nD: OK. Does he ever feel like his heart's racing?\n\nP: Uhm, no. \n\nD: No, OK. Uhm how about any dizziness or fainting spells?\n\nP: No, he doesn't have anything like that.\n\nD: OK, has he had a sore throat?\n\nP: No, no.\n\nD: Any changes in vision or hearing?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Uh, smell or taste?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No. Weight loss?\n\nP: No, he's been gaining weight well.\n\nD: OK, how about any rashes?\n\nP: Nope, I haven't noticed any.\n\nD: OK, uhm, and then any numbness or tingling?\n\nP: No, he hasn't said anything like that.\n\nD: OK, muscle aches or joint aches?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. Confusion or memory loss?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Changes in his bowel movements?\n\nP: Nope, yeah, that's been been getting out, no diarrhea or anything like that. \n\nD: OK. Changes in his voiding?\n\nP: Nope, he hasn't had any urinary problems.\n\nD: OK. And is he an otherwise healthy child? Umm, does he have any longstanding medical conditions?\n\nP: No, he doesn't. That's uh, this was so surprising, he's been healthy.\n\nD: OK. Has he, so he's never had any hospitalizations or surgeries? \n\nP: No, he hasn't.\n\nD: OK. How about his mother's pregnancy with him? Were there any complications at that point?\n\nP: Nope, everything went went well. No complications and he was like a good birth weight and went home right away. \n\nD: OK. OK, and how about the delivery itself? Any complications during that, that point?\n\nP: Oh no, not it was a vaginal delivery and it was normal.\n\nD: OK. And he didn't need to be hospitalized as a newborn for anything like jaundice or shortness of breath?\n\nP: Uh, nope, he hasn't had any any reason to be hospitalized.\n\nD: OK. Uhm alright. And has he been hitting all his developmental milestones as well as like his height, weight and head circumference milestones?\n\nP: He has, yeah, he's been growing well and reaching the developments stones, milestones.\n\nD: OK, is he on any medications?\n\nP: Uh, no he's not on any medications.\n\nD: OK. Any allergies?\n\nP: No allergies.\n\nD: Uhm, is he up to date with all his immunizations?\n\nP: He is, yeah. \n\nD: OK. Any family history of lung or heart conditions.\n\nP: Uh, no, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK. Have about cancers in the family?\n\nP: No, no cancers luckily.\n\nD: Can you think of anyone he's been in contact with who's also been sick?\n\nP: Yeah, maybe, he has a younger sister that goes to daycare and she was sick last week with like she had a cough and stuff as well.\n\nD: OK. OK, and does she have a fever as well?\n\nP: She did, yeah, she got better. Right uh, last week we we had to take her to to see the doctor and she got antibiotics for that. Actually for, for a few days. \n\nD: OK, OK. And have you traveled anywhere recently?\n\nP: No, we've been at home.\n\nD: OK. Does anyone at home smoke?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: No, OK. And who lives at home with him?\n\nP: So it's me, his mom, and then his younger sister.\n\nD: OK. Any old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, anything that could exacerbate his condition?\n\nP: No, I don't think so. It's a newer home. \n\nD: OK, good. Umm, so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?\n\nP: Uhm, no, I, no that was everything I think. The only I I guess other thing that that I forgot to mention is that just he doesn't really like his appetite's been a little bit lower couple of days as well. But uh, he hasn't had any, like nausea or vomiting though.\n\nD: OK, OK, yeah, that's good to know. Uhm, so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. And it doesn't, it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia, so for that we will get a chest x-ray, we'll check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x-ray shows consolidation umm, or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms. They should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, just take him to the ER. And if symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days, we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or TB, or things like that. How does that sound?\n\nP: That sounds great. Thank you.\n\nD: OK, yeah, no problem.\n\n",

    "ref_norm_d": "what brings you in ok uhm before the fever did you notice any other symptoms like a runny nose or a stuffy nose ok and did you take his temperature at home ok and you mentioned the coughing started soon after the fever correct ok and is it a dry cough or is it a productive cough ok what color is the sputum greenish yellow ok any blood in there ok and does he seem short of breath or wheezy ok and the service of bread started with a cough ok uhm how much shortness of breath is he having is it just when he is exerting himself or is it at rest as well ok umm and it does anything help with that so does sitting up help or you know getting fresh air or anything like that ok ok and how about when he is laying down ok is it waking him up from sleep no ok how about chest pain ok does he ever feel like his heart is racing no ok uhm how about any dizziness or fainting spells ok has he had a sore throat any changes in vision or hearing smell or taste no weight loss ok how about any rashes ok uhm and then any numbness or tingling ok muscle aches or joint aches ok confusion or memory loss changes in his bowel movements ok changes in his voiding ok and is he an otherwise healthy child umm does he have any longstanding medical conditions ok has he so he is never had any hospitalizations or surgeries ok how about his mother is pregnancy with him were there any complications at that point ok ok and how about the delivery itself any complications during that that point ok and he did not need to be hospitalized as a newborn for anything like jaundice or shortness of breath ok uhm alright and has he been hitting all his developmental milestones as well as like his height weight and head circumference milestones ok is he on any medications ok any allergies uhm is he up to date with all his immunizations ok any family history of lung or heart conditions ok have about cancers in the family can you think of anyone he has been in contact with who is also been sick ok ok and does she have a fever as well ok ok and have you traveled anywhere recently ok does anyone at home smoke no ok and who lives at home with him ok any old carpets mold dust asbestos anything that could exacerbate his condition ok good umm so those are all the questions that i had for you did you have any questions of your own ok ok yeah that is good to know uhm so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of covid we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms and it does not it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia so for that we will get a chest x ray we will check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x ray shows consolidation umm or some sort of infiltrate it is likely that he has pneumonia so we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for 5 days and just keep monitoring his symptoms they should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete if his condition gets worse like he is getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures just take him to the er and if symptoms do not resolve in 5 to 7 days we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or tb or things like that how does that sound ok yeah no problem",
