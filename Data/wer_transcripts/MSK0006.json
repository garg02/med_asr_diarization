Um and where do you currently live?\n\nP: So I live in a house with my um with my wife uh yeah and son.\n\nD: OK, alright and, OK so now I'm just going to move on to the physical exam part of this um and I'm going to ask you to do a few things, OK? So, well just by looking at your legs, or if you have a mirror um and you can look at your right buttock area, um do you see any swelling or redness?\n\nP: Um no, I don't see anything like that.\n\nD: OK. And does it feel hot?\n\nP: No, it doesn't feel hot.\n\nD: OK. And do you see any skin changes?\n\nP: No skin changes.\n\nD: Um any atrophy or deformity in the area?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, um has your gait changed, like does it, are you limping, hobbling, anything like that?\n\nP: Um yeah, I feel like I've been limping a little bit, uh yeah.\n\nD: Are you putting more um pressure on the left foot then?\n\nP: I am, yeah, yeah, I guess there's like an antalgic gait. \n\nD: OK, alright, and then um if you press down on your hipbone, do you feel any pain there? On your right hip bone. \n\nP: No, I don't.\n\nD: OK, how about when you press down on your buttocks itself? \n\nP: Um yeah, there is uh a little bit of tenderness um over the buttock area.\n\nD: OK, how about the back of your legs?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, how about the front um of your legs, thighs?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, OK. Alright, um and then I'm gonna just get you to do a few movements um with me as well. Would you uh OK, so are you sitting down right now?\n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: OK. Would you mind standing up from a sitting position?\n\nP: Yeah, for sure.\n\nD: Does that hurt?\n\nP: It uh yeah, that that that causes pain.\n\nD: OK, so that causes, so um hip hip extension uh that causes some pain, um and as well as knee extension, so would you mind um kicking your right leg up in front of you all the way up as far as you can go?\n\nP: Mhmm, oh yeah. \n\nD: Does that hurt?\n\nP: It does, yeah. \n\nD: OK so right hip flexion um also causes pain, and then would you mind uh folding your knees backwards um and just sort of flexing it? Does that hurt?\n\nP: Uh no.\n\nD: OK, so no pain at knee flexion. And how about when you point your feet um and toes up towards the ceiling?\n\nP: Uhm yeah I I do get some pain with my um, yeah when that's all straightened out, yeah. \n\nD: OK, so some pain on um planter flexion of the right foot. And how about if you um point your feet and toes towards the ground?\n\nP: No pain there.\n\nD: OK, um alright and how about when you uh kick your legs uh to the side and upwards?\n\nP: Oh uh no pain with abduction.\n\nD: OK so no pain on right hip abduction, and then how about when you bring it back down?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK and no pain on hip adduction. OK, well those are all the questions that I have for you. Do you have any questions for myself?\n\nP: Uh just wondering about possibly like what it could be. \n\nD: Yeah, um so it sounds um right now like you may have some sort of uh sacral nerve radiculopathy um or or like a lower lumbar, lumbar um radiculopathy, um basically uh that's known as sciatica, uh where your nerve roots can be compressed, causing some of these symptoms. Um and to diagnose these things, usually it's just done by history and physical exam um but if after we try out some management things, it doesn't go away or you're having some red flags, including um numbness in the groin area, bowel or bladder incontinence, then we can look at some um imaging for the for the spine, including MRI. Um and so in terms of management of this, um we can try a couple couple of like conservative approaches first, so that includes taking NSAIDs uh for the pain um and then like activity modification. So if you're sitting down um all the time, um perhaps like taking little breaks, uh stretching out your legs, doing some physio as well um during those breaks can help um, and as well, I'm going to give you a referral for physical therapy and they'll do some exercises with you and um slowly increase those exercises. Um and if those still don't work, we can try um steroids, steroid injections, um as well, we talked about the imaging if it doesn't go away in about 6 to 8 weeks. Does that sound OK?\n\nP: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. \n\nD: OK, yeah no problem.",

loss fevers or chills no fevers or chills rashes no rashes changes to your vision hearing smell or taste no are you coughing having shortness of breath or wheezing no i have not been any having any symptoms like that ok any chest pain palpitations or dizziness or fainting spells no nothing like that any changes to your bowel movements no diarrhea or constipation and no bleeding in the stool no blood in the stool ok and then how about nausea or vomiting no i have not had any nausea or vomiting ok changes to your urine no no changes to the urine ok and are you otherwise healthy do you have any longstanding medical conditions i do have high blood pressure and high cholesterol and i take medications for those i take amlodipine and a statin ok do you have any other medical conditions are are you on any other medications besides those just a multivitamin ok and are you up to date with all your immunizations i am yes ok any allergies no i do not believe so no family history of musculoskeletal or neurological issues no nothing like that autoimmune conditions no nothing like that cancers no no ok and do you smoke yeah i smoke about half a pack of cigarettes per day ok for how long have you been doing that for yeah about 40 years 40 years ok have you ever thought of quitting i have yeah i have cut down over the years i used to smoke more it is just the culture with i do not know everybody is driving a truck and smoking ok yeah that is hard if you ever need any resources we have some that we can refer you to thank you yeah no worries and do you consume marijuana no i do not ok how about other recreational drugs nope nothing like that before ok do you drink alcohol yeah i will have a beer or 2 on the weekend so maybe a couple of drinks per week ok and how about do sick contacts have you been in touch with any recently no i have not been around anybody who has been sick ok any travel recently just for the drop offs that i that i make driving i do have to make some pretty long hauls back and forth the yeah ok and where do you currently live so i live in a house with my with my wife yeah and son ok alright and ok so now i am just going to move on to the physical exam part of this and i am going to ask you to do a few things ok so well just by looking at your legs or if you have a mirror and you can look at your right buttock area do you see any swelling or redness no i do not see anything like that ok and does it feel hot no it does not feel hot ok and do you see any skin changes no skin changes any atrophy or deformity in the area no no has your gait changed like does it are you limping hobbling anything like that yeah i feel like i have been limping a little bit yeah are you putting more pressure on the left foot then i am yeah yeah i guess there is like an antalgic gait ok alright and then if you press down on your hipbone do you feel any pain there on your right hip bone no i do not ok how about when you press down on your buttocks itself yeah there is a little bit of tenderness over the buttock area ok how about the back of your legs no ok how about the front of your legs thighs no no ok alright and then i am going to just get you to do a few movements with me as well would you ok so are you sitting down right now yeah ok would you mind standing up from a sitting position yeah for sure does that hurt it yeah that that that causes pain ok so that causes so hip hip extension that causes some pain and as well as knee extension so would you mind kicking your right leg up in front of you all the way up as far as you can go mhmm 0 yeah does that hurt it does yeah ok so right hip flexion also causes pain and then would you mind folding your knees backwards and just sort of flexing it does that hurt no ok so no pain at knee flexion and how about when you point your feet and toes up towards the ceiling uhm yeah i i do get some pain with my yeah when that is all straightened out yeah ok so some pain on planter flexion of the right foot and how about if you point your feet and toes towards the ground no pain there ok alright and how about when you kick your legs to the side and upwards 0 no pain with abduction ok so no pain on right hip abduction and then how about when you bring it back down no ok and no pain on hip adduction ok well those are all the questions that i have for you do you have any questions for myself just wondering about possibly like what it could be yeah so it sounds right now like you may have some sort of sacral nerve radiculopathy or or like a lower lumbar lumbar radiculopathy basically that is known as sciatica where your nerve roots can be compressed causing some of these symptoms and to diagnose these things usually it is just done by history and physical exam but if after we try out some management things it does not go away or you are having some red flags including numbness in the groin area bowel or bladder incontinence then we can look at some imaging for the for the spine including mri and so in terms of management of this we can try a couple couple of like conservative approaches 1st so that includes taking nsaids for the pain and then like activity modification so if you are sitting down all the time perhaps like taking little breaks stretching out your legs doing some physio as well during those breaks can help and as well i am going to give you a referral for physical therapy and they will do some exercises with you and slowly increase those exercises and if those still do not work we can try steroids steroid injections as well we talked about the imaging if it does not go away in about 6 to 8 weeks does that sound ok yeah that sounds good thank you ok yeah no problem",
