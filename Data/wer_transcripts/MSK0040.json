Alright, could you tell me a little bit about your living situation right now, like who you're living with and whereabouts?\n\nP: I live with both my parents as well as two of my siblings. They are younger. We live in a house downtown. \n\nD: OK and are you currently in school?\n\nP: I am.

And in the family, has there been any history of musculoskeletal or neurological problems?\n\nP: Uh, no, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, and how about any autoimmune conditions?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and so I next wanted to move to the physical exam component and ask you to have a look at your ankles. And are you seeing any swelling or redness or discolouration?\n\nP: So I there's a. Like there's a bruise about 4 centimeters wide and it appear swollen, but just by right ankle.\n\nD: Just your right ankle, OK. And is there any temperature changes like warmth when you touch it?\n\nP: Uh slightly warm yeah.\n\nD: OK. And are you seeing any muscle atrophy or deformities of the of the ankle or foot.\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK. Uhm and, uh if you press on areas of your of your ankle and foot, do you feel pain at the lateral malleolus or the medial malleolus?\n\nP: Uh, there's a lot of pain on the lateral malleolus.\n\nD: OK. Um and do you feel pain if you press on the top of your foot like a?\n\nP: Um on the, no no pain at the top of my foot.\n\nD: OK, and how about on the like outside or lateral aspect of your foot you'll feel a kind of, it's a bony prominence that that sticks out at the base of the 5th or you're kind of last metatarsals is there any pain there?\n\nP: No, no pain there.\n\nD: OK, and then how about any pains on that like medial side of your foot?\n\nP: On the medial side, no.\n\nD: OK, and then when it comes to moving the foot, are you able to point your toes on your foot up towards your face?\n\nP: Up towards my face that's hard.\n\nD: OK, so dorsiflexion is limited. And how about pushing your foot down like you're pressing on the gas pedal?\n\nP: I can do that, but it's still painful just to move the ankle.\n\nD: OK, so planter flexion is is painful as well. And then any issues with moving your toes?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and then you mentioned that with walking you're having a limp currently?\n\nP: Yes.\n\nD: OK, so we have an antalgic gates with an inability to bear weight as well. OK, so the that was everything that I wanted to ask and check today and based on these features it is starting like it could be either an ankle fracture or an ankle sprain. But because of the pin-point tenderness or that you're finding on the lateral side as well as some of the the inability to bear weight as you're describing it'll be important to get an X-Ray to make sure that there's not a fracture. Um and yeah, and if there is then it will be important to have some sort of air boot or casting so that to make sure that we're offloading the area for the bones to heal, but we'll see what the X-Ray shows.\n\nP: OK, that sounds great, thank you. \n\nD: Thank you.\n",

and then any issues with moving your toes okay and then you mentioned that with walking you are having a limp currently okay so there will be an intalligate gait with an inability to bear weight as well so that was everything that i wanted to ask and check today and based on these features it is sounding like it could be either an ankle fracture or an ankle sprain but because of the pinpoint tenderness that you are finding on the lateral side as well as some of the inability to bear weight as you are describing it will be important to get an x ray to make sure that there is not a fracture and if there is then it will be important to have some sort of air boot or casting to make sure that we are offloading the area for the bones to heal but we will see what the x ray shows thank you",
    "ref_norm": "how may i help you so i have had this ankle pain for the past day and and it does not seem to be getting better my right ankle looks swollen and it is bruised and is pretty painful so i just wanted to come here to check check it out see if i need any thing done to it yeah absolutely ok so you said that this started yesterday was there any like trauma to the ankle or leg or did you

an i kind of fell on on my ankle kind of just above above my lateral side of the foot so where that bony prominence is ok i see and and your foot kind of it turned inwards when you fell yes that is right ok and was there pain immediately after the this incident yes ok were you able to like walk off the field at all or did you need to be carried or were you able to walk at any point after so i
