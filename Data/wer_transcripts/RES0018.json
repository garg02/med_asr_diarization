    "ref": "P: I've just been having this this cough over the last few days and I also notice that I'm getting like these headaches and chills as well at night. So I was just a bit concerned.\n\nD: OK, so the cough started a few days ago. Have you been bringing up any phlegm? \n\nP: No, not really. It's been pretty much like a dry cough. I did feel like a tickle in my throat before it started, but no, I'm not producing any phlegm.\n\nD: OK, um is the cough any worse at any particular time of day, like when you first get up or or at night when going to bed?\n\nP: No, it's pretty much just been there over the last, at least like 2 days.

Just it's been pretty nonstop.\n\nD: OK, anything that's made the cough worse?\n\nP: Uh, no, not really. It's uh, pretty much been the same for the last few days. \n\nD: Anything you've tried to make the cough go away? \n\nP: Just like Tylenol cold. And then I think there was another over the counter medication that I took, but nothing really helping.\n\nD: OK and uh, the cough has been been getting worse. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?\n\nP: Um, I did just just last night, actually. I thought that I had some shortness of breath as well. I don't know if that's being caused by all the coughing, but yeah, I got pretty scared, so that's why I'm here today.\n\nD: OK, um has anything like this happened to you before? \n\nP: No, like I've been pretty healthy otherwise completely so this is this is completely new for me.\n\nD: Ok, and yeah, you mentioned you had a fever but did have you checked your temperature? \n\nP: No, I haven't I I just had like chills over the last two nights.

And yeah, currently, working as an engineer. Yeah, pretty everything else is pretty good. \n\nD: OK, um have you had to miss work over the last few days? \n\nP: Yeah, I actually didn't go to work yesterday, just felt terrible yesterday.\n\nD: OK how have the wife and kids been feeling at home? \n\nP: They're actually completely fine now. They don't seem to have any any symptoms of like coughing or anything like that.\n\nD: Anybody at work that's been sick?\n\nP: There was actually like just we work in the same kind of office setting. One of my coworkers was coughing just last week and like you know, my boss told us, told him to like, go home and get some rest and he was away for a couple days. \n\nD: OK, uh, do you know what um what he had or anything like that?\n\nP: No, I'm not really sure. Now that I think of it, like I I don't I haven't seen him since. Uh, so I haven't really asked him. Yeah, I'm not really sure.\n\nD: OK. Has have you traveled anywhere, or has anybody in your office been been traveling anywhere?\n\nP: No, not really. Not that I know, everything is pretty strict right now with with the pandemic going on.\n\nD: OK. Um and yeah, do you smoke cigarettes? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Do you drink alcohol? \n\nP: Just rarely, maybe a couple times a month.\n\nD: OK, do you use recreational drugs like IV drug use or opioids or crystal meth, anything like that? \n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, and are you currently sexually active? \n\nP: Yep. \n\nD: OK, could you tell me a little bit about your your partner or partners? \n\nP: Just my wife, no other sexual partners.\n\nD: OK and have you had a sexually transmitted infection before? \n\nP: Nope.\n\nD: OK, and so in regards to your family history, has anybody had similar symptoms before?\n\nP: No, not really.

I am concerned that you might might have COVID-19 or coronavirus. And so it could be COVID, or this could be another viral infection or possibly pneumonia going on. But it does sound like you have an infection and so we'll check some sputum cultures. And and we'll also do a PCR nasal swab testing for COVID. So we'll go ahead and order those tests and we'll see what their their results say. \n\nP: Alright, sounds good.\n",
