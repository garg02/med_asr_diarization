You may have injured yourself and we just want to make sure there's no fractures like a hip fracture. \n\nP: OK.\n\nD: One thing that's also something that we have to investigate is something called slipped capital femoral epiphysis. So this is, this is a common hip issue in adolescents, especially from boys aged 10 to 16. And usually it's the left hip that's affected, but it it can be the right. And as adolescents are in a phase where they were growing, there is, if they have some predisposed disposition too slipping of the capital femoral if epiphysis, which is right between your hips, you can get some slipping. It can be after a fall or it can happen just as the child is growing, and it can also it is also associated with the increasing weight that a child may have. So what we can do is just get first an X-Ray of both the hips. \n\nP: OK.\n\nD: And see like what we can find on the X-Ray and then will also do a full examination. And it, if it does turn out that there is a fracture or there's a slipped capital femoral epiphysis we will need to send out a referral to pediatric orthopedic surgery.\n\nP: OK.\n\nD: Yeah, so yeah, first we'll just get the image Ng done and see what's going on in there and then we'll get back to you shortly.\n\nP: OK, that sounds great.

epiphysis so this is this is a common hip issue in adolescents especially from boys aged 10 to 16 and usually it is the left hip that is affected but it it can be the right and as adolescents are in a phase where they were growing there is if they have some predisposed disposition too slipping of the capital femoral if epiphysis which is right between your hips you can get some slipping it can be after a fall or it can happen just as the child is growing and it can also it is also associated with the increasing weight that a child may have so what we can do is just get 1st an x ray of both the hips ok and see like what we can find on the x ray and then will also do a full examination and it if it does turn out that there is a fracture or there is a slipped capital femoral epiphysis we will need to send out a referral to pediatric orthopedic surgery ok yeah so yeah 1st we will just get the image ng done and see what is going on in there and then we will get back to you shortly ok that
