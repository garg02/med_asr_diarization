Has she come in contact with anyone sick recently?\n\nP: Um, no.\n\nD: Have you done any travel recently?\n\nP: Nope.\n\nD: Okay. Alright, and those are all the questions I had for history taking. Let's move on to the physical exam part of this interview. Um, I'm just going to get you to take a look at both her elbows and arms. Do you see any, um, redness or swelling in the right elbow compared to the left?\n\nP: No, I don't see that. No, I don't see any changes.\n\nD: Okay, how about um, any muscle atrophy, deformities, or skin changes, like bruises?\n\nP: Um, no, I don't see anything like that.\n\nD: Okay. How about, um, when you palpate her elbows, does, is she in pain? \n\nP: Um, she doesn't really let me, but if I try to, I think that does cause her some pain. \n\nD: Okay, how about when you palpate her like forearm muscles?\n\nP: Um, no, not as much.\n\nD: Okay, how about her biceps and triceps?\n\nP: Um, no, not really.\n\nD: No, okay. Um, alright, and those are all the questions that I kind of had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself?\n\nP: No, I just wanted to find out if she broke something, or like, yeah, I didn't know what was going on.\n\nD: Okay. Yeah, it seems like someone of her age and just the kind of history that you're giving me, it sounds like she has something called a radial head subluxation. Um, and that's usually caused in young children when they're like pulled or lifted by the hand or wrist while their arm is held straight, um, which can kind of pull the bone out of its socket a little bit. Um, so um, in terms of like a management plan, you can try conservative things like ice packs, um, over the counter painkillers. Um, otherwise, we can try to um, put the radius back into its normal position here, which will just take uh, like a few minutes. Um, and, and then after we reduce it back into its place, um, she should have normal function of her arm again. Um, if she's still experiencing pain, we can continue keeping it on a splint, um, but otherwise, I don't think we need any imaging for this at this um, at this time. So did you have any questions or any concerns about that?\n\nP: No, I think that's, um, that's a good plan.\n\nD: Okay, great. Um, thank you.\n\nP: Thank you.",

    "ref_norm_d": "what brings you in 0 yeah for sure when did this start okay okay and did anything happen to trigger this did she fall on that arm or like injuries okay alright and in terms of the type of pain she is having right now did she say if it was a dull achy kind of pain or is it sharp okay and has it been constant since she started experiencing this or does it come and go okay and then is the pain just in the elbow or does it radiate down into her hands or up to her shoulders okay have you tried anything for this pain yeah one to 10 10 being the worst type of pain how bad is this pain for her okay and then has she ever experienced pain like this in the past okay and then does she have any numbness or tingling in the area okay how about memory loss or confusion any headaches dizziness or fainting spells any weight loss recently fevers or chills rashes changes in vision hearing smell or taste any coughing shortness of breath or wheezing any chest pain or heart palpitations any changes in bowel movements how about changes in urine okay and is she otherwise healthy does she have any longstanding medical conditions okay and with her mother is pregnancy with her were there any complications at that point okay and no issues as a neonate okay that is good and then she has not had any hospitalizations or surgery since then alright his she on any medications okay is she up to date with her immunizations okay how about allergies does she have any okay any family history of musculoskeletal issues lung or heart conditions autoimmune conditions cancers is she like on par with her peers in terms of developments and reaching milestones okay and who does she live with at home okay and does anyone at home smoke any concerns for her safety at home no okay and how are things at school for her okay that is good has she come in contact with anyone sick recently have you done any travel recently okay alright and those are all the questions i had for history taking let us move on to the physical exam part of this interview i am just going to get you to take a look at both her elbows and arms do you see any redness or swelling in the right elbow compared to the left okay how about any muscle atrophy deformities or skin changes like bruises okay how about when you palpate her elbows does is she in pain okay how about when you palpate her like forearm muscles okay how about her biceps and triceps no okay alright and those are all the questions that i kind of had for you did you have any questions of your own for myself okay yeah it seems like someone of her age and just the kind of history that you are giving me it sounds like she has something called a radial head subluxation and that is usually caused in young children when they are like pulled or lifted by the hand or wrist while their arm is held straight which can kind of pull the bone out of its socket a little bit so in terms of like a management plan you can try conservative things like ice packs over the counter painkillers otherwise we can try to put the radius back into its normal position here which will just take like a few minutes and and then after we reduce it back into its place she should have normal function of her arm again if she is still experiencing pain we can continue keeping it on a splint but otherwise i do not think we need any imaging for this at this at this time so did you have any questions or any concerns about that okay great thank you",
