Um I think those are all the questions that I had for you, um did you have any questions of your own for myself?\n\nP: Uh no, I was just wondering what this pain could be on my, in my elbow. \n\nD: Yeah, so right now it seems like you may have a case of something called um lateral epicondylitis. So, it's also known as uh tennis elbow, um and there are a lot of things that could kind of predispose you to this, um so it could be like the repetitive strain at work, um and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor muscle group there. Um so for this we basically recommend um a couple of things to manage the pain. Uh but first, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma and I'm not too worried about any fractures. Um so to help you treat this, um we recommend some activity modifications, so um at work not doing things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those um extensor forearm muscles. Um and then you can use some, use a compression sleeve as well, continue taking Tylenol or NSAIDs for the pain and uh really important is physical therapy um to increase mobility and strength in that arm. Uh and as well you can apply things like ice um to it for like the pain and swelling if you see any. Uh, yeah, so it should resolve in about six months to two years at most, uh but normally it does um go away in a couple of months with some physical therapy and the compression and splints if you choose to do that. How does that sound?\n\nP: Yeah, that that sounds um good, thank you.\n\nD: Yeah, no worries.",

    "ref_norm": "what brings you in hi i have i have had this pain on the outside of my right elbow now it is it i 1st started knowing noticing it several months ago but recently it is just been more painful ok so you said several months ago did anything happen several months ago was there any sort of trigger trauma anything like that to that area no there was not any any trauma or any triggers that that i noticed i was just feeling it a bit more at the end of of work yeah i was just having it feeling the pain a bit more at the end of work ok does anything make it better or worse the pain yeah if i really if i am just resting the elbow it makes it better and i have tried things like ibuprofen which has helped with the pain i will i will do that for hoping i can get through work sometimes if the pain is bad enough right ok and if you were to describe the quality of the pain is it sharp throbby achy it is kind of well it is achy and then sometimes depending on the movement it can get it can be sharp as well it can be sharp ok ok and what sorts of movements make it worse so like really it is mostly the movements at my wrist if i am bending my wrist down i can i can feel it or if i am having to pick things up or hold heavy objects at work i do a lot of repetitive things at at work i work on a line ok ok and one to 10 10 being the worst pain you have ever felt how bad is this pain it is about a 4 about a 4 ok and have you ever experienced this type of pain before no i have not no ok and do you feel like your pain is getting worse over the past several months or is it the same getting better it has been getting worse it has been getting worse ok ok have you tried any like topical ointments or anything like that for it i did i yeah i tried some some stuff that you can get at the drugstore and it did help take the edge off a little bit ok alright and are you still able to move that arm your right arm as well as your hand i am yeah i i have full range of motion of both the elbow and hand ok and it is not like preventing you from doing everyday tasks no i i have been been able to manage so far at work but it is starting to become an issue yeah with my job ok alright and then do you have any sorts of aches or pains in any other joint or muscle groups no it is just right there on the outside of my right elbow and it is really annoying cause i am right handed as well so yeah it is causing problems there right and is the pain radiating upwards or downwards no i kinda just feel it right over that that one spot ok any numbness or tingling in that arm no no no numbness or tingling yeah ok and then how about like your arm feeling like it is cold no i have not had anything like that ok alright and then otherwise do you have any other symptoms no i it is just been the elbow pain ok so no weight loss no my weights been stable over these last few months ok fevers or chills no i have not had any fevers or chills ok any fatigue no my energy has been good ok how about rashes no rashes ok changes to your senses like vision hearing smell smell or taste no changes there ok any coughing shortness of breath or wheezing no ok chest pain any heart palpitations or dizziness nothing like that ok changes to your bowel movements no no no no nausea or vomiting no i have not had any nausea or vomiting ok changes to your urine no i have not had any urinary symptoms ok memory loss or confusion no ok so if you look at that right elbow do you notice any redness or swelling no i do not no ok does it seem misaligned or like asymmetrical compared to your other elbow no it looks it looks the same looks the same ok so no skin changes or deformities there no no ok alright and now i am going to get you to just palpate that lateral or yeah the lateral aspect of that elbow and you let me know if you feel pain when you push push on that there is pain at the lateral lateral elbow how about the medial aspect no pain no pain ok and how about when you palpate your forearm and your biceps no no pain ok alright and then do you feel like it is hot that area no no ok now i am going to get you to extend your wrist ok and then keep your elbow in full extension as well does that hurt it does yeah yeah ok how about when you flex your wrist with the elbow still in full extension it does yeah that hurts as well ok how about when you flex your elbow no that that does not cause any pain ok how about when you extend your shoulder all the way up no nothing there that feels fine ok and then flexing your or sorry abducting your shoulder that feels normal ok alright and then how about when you pronate and supinate your forearms pronation so like twist your arm inwards so that your palm is facing the floor no that does not really cause any pain pronation and supination ok alright alright and then are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions i am healthy you are healthy ok and then do you have have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past i had a surgery for a c section for my my son but that is that is it ok ok and how long ago was that that was about 17 years ago ok and was that an emergency c section no it was not ok and then are you on any medications no i have just been taking tylenol and advil for the pain ok alright immunizations wise are you up to date i i am yes ok do you have any allergies no allergies ok family history of any skeletal or muscular issues no nothing like that in the family ok neurological issues in the family no neurological issues in the family ok how about autoimmune conditions no nothing like that ok and then do you smoke no i have not smoked before ok do you do marijuana no i i do not use that ok alcohol yeah i will have a glass of wine every once in awhile but maybe just 11 a week ok and have you been around sick contacts recently no i have not been around anybody who has been sick ok any recent travel nope i have been at home ok i think those are all the questions that i had for you did you have any questions of your own for myself no i was just wondering what this pain could be on my in my elbow yeah so right now it seems like you may have a case of something called lateral epicondylitis so it is also known as tennis elbow and there are a lot of things that could kind of predispose you to this so it could be like the repetitive strain at work and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor muscle group there so for this we basically recommend a couple of things to manage the pain but 1st like in terms of imaging i do not think it is necessary because it does not seem like there was any trauma and i am not too worried about any fractures so to help you treat this we recommend some activity modifications so at work not doing things that are too repetitive especially if it is using those extensor forearm muscles and then you can use some use a compression sleeve as well continue taking tylenol or nsaids for the pain and really important is physical therapy to increase mobility and strength in that arm and as well you can apply things like ice to it for like the pain and swelling if you see any yeah so it should resolve in about 6 months to 2 years at most but normally it does go away in a couple of months with some physical therapy and the compression and splints if you choose to do that how does that sound yeah that that sounds good thank you yeah no worries",
