Um so I'm going to get you to stand up from a sitting position. Does that hurt your back?\n\nP: Um yeah it does. I I do feel a little bit of a a twinge there.\n\nD: OK, and where about specifically?\n\nP: Kind of just, yeah, on the lower uh lower right side like more on the, more on the right side.\n\nD: More on the right side, OK. Now, if you have a mirror with you, or if you have someone there with you who can um speak to this, does your right side appear more red, swollen, or hot compared to your left side of the lower back?\n\nP: Uh no, nothing like that. \n\nD: No, OK, and does it seem like it's more atrophied or do you see any deformities or skin changes in that area?\n\nP: Uh nope, no deformities or skin changes. \n\nD: OK, um alright and I'm gonna get you to um bend down all the way and touch your toes if you can.\n\nP: Um yeah I I can get part part way down.\n\nD: You can get partway down, does it hurt?\n\nP: Um a little bit, I can feel it pulling and stretching, yeah.\n\nD: OK. Um alright, and then I'm gonna get you to uh like laterally flex to your right side. So kind of like you're doing an exercise um and you're just like bending towards that side.\n\nP: Yeah, that hurts.\n\nD: That hurts, OK, how about the other side, the left side?\n\nP: Yeah that hurts too.\n\nD: OK. Um and now I wanna get you to uh bring your knees up towards the ceiling. Does that hurt? One at a time, like your right right knee and your left knee.\n\nP: Uh, not really.\n\nD: No, OK, how about when you um flex your knees backwards?\n\nP: Nope.\n\nD: And kind of point your knees towards the ground.\n\nP: No, no pain there.\n\nD: OK, so no pain on knee extension or flexion. Um how about when you point your toes to the ceiling?\n\nP: Uh no pain there.\n\nD: OK so no pain on plantar flexion, how about when you point your uh toes to the ground?\n\nP: No pain there.\n\nD: OK, so no pain on dorsiflexion, and then sorry I forgot to ask you earlier, do you have any sort of numbness in the groin area?\n\nP: No, no numbness in the groin area.\n\nD: OK, so no numbness in the groin area, no weakness, no um changes in your bowel or bladder habits, including no incontinence, so uh no red flags?\n\nP: Yeah, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, OK, good um and, OK so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for myself?\n\nP: Uh, no I was just uh yeah, kind of wondering do I do I need any X Rays or like what what what's going on?\n\nD: Yeah, so um what it sounds like right now is that you have something called mechanical back pain. It's pretty common and um it can be anything from your spinal joints to the discs to the vertebrate or soft tissue or muscle. Um and a lot of these can be caused by um hard activity at work, um like carrying heavy things um and then carrying them in like an improper position or something like that. Um and we diagnose that on history and physical exam, um but if after we try some management and treatment plans, it doesn't go away and it persists for more than eight weeks, we do recommend imaging, including an MRI. So uh in terms of management for right now, um modified activity at work, um some short term bed rest, uh very short term though um and bed rest is only really recommended if you have severe back pain and muscle spasms, um and you definitely shouldn't be doing that for more than like 24 to 48 hours, and physical activity can help, um so referral to physical therapy or physiotherapy um can help in rehab and they'll give you some exercises that you can try at home to kind of um strengthen those muscles. And then ice and heating packs um temporarily can help, uh medications like NSAIDs can help as well with the inflammation. Um so we'll try these things out and then we'll continue to follow up. Um yeah, did you have any questions or does that sound like an OK plan?\n\nP: Uh that sounds like a good plan.\n\nD: OK, sounds good, thank you.",

to the area no i can not think of anything like specific that happened but there was one night where like after work i was sitting down after dinner and i got pretty stiff that night it was pretty sore and kind of ever since then it has been been sore ok ok and is this a persistent kind of back pain or does it come and go it is i can kind of always feel it but it certainly gets worse if i am moving so if i am just kind of sitting at rest i do not really yeah i do not really feel it that much ok ok and if you were to describe the quality of this pain would you say it is sharp throbbing achy crampy i would say i get kind of it is a sharp pain sharp pain ok does anything make it better or worse better would just be resting ok kind of just lying down or yeah just just trying to rest

longstanding medical conditions i i have had a few sports injuries when i was younger like to my my knee but that is it i have been healthy otherwise ok and those injuries are they all healed sometimes i will get like a little achiness in my knee from from doing like too much activity but i know when those when that happens ok are you on any medications no i i do not take any medications

have a couple of beers on the weekend so maybe like 2 or 3 ok uhm and who and where do you live right who with and where do you live right now yeah i live with my wife and our and our son who is in high school we live in a in a house ok ok alright and any concerns for sti is at all 0 no i have been with my wife now for a long time and we have been monogamous so no concerns for sexually transmitted infection right now ok how about sick contacts have you been in contact with anyone sick recently no i do not think so ok any travel recently no i have not traveled anywhere ok and well let us move on to the physical exam part of this interview so i am going to get you to stand up from a sitting position does that hurt your back yeah it does i i do feel a little bit of a a twinge there ok and where about specifically kind of just yeah on the lower lower right side like more on the more on the right side more on the right side ok now if you have a mirror with you or if you have someone there with you who can speak to this does your right side appear more red swollen or hot compared to your left side of the lower back no nothing like that no ok and does it seem like it is more atrophied or do you see any deformities or skin changes in that area nope no deformities or skin changes ok alright and i am going to get you to bend down all the way and touch your toes if you can yeah i i can get part part way down you can get partway down does it hurt a little bit i can feel it pulling and stretching yeah ok alright and then i am going to get you to like laterally flex to your right side so kind of like you are doing an exercise and you are just like bending towards that side yeah that hurts that hurts ok how about the other side the left side yeah that hurts too ok and now i want to get you to bring your knees up towards the ceiling does that hurt one at a time like your right right knee and your left knee not really no ok how about when you flex your knees backwards nope and kind of point your knees towards the ground no no pain there ok so no pain on knee extension or flexion how about when you point your toes to the ceiling no pain there ok so no pain

area no no numbness in the groin area ok so no numbness in the groin area no weakness no changes in your bowel or bladder habits including no incontinence so no red flags yeah nothing like that ok ok good and ok so those are all the questions that i had for you did you have any questions for myself no i was just yeah kind of wondering do i do i need any x rays or like what what what is going on yeah so what it sounds like right now is that you have something called mechanical back pain it is pretty common and it can be anything from your spinal joints to the disks to the vertebrate or soft tissue or muscle and a lot of these can be caused by hard activity at work like carrying heavy things and then carrying them in like an improper position or something like that and we diagnose that on history and physical exam but if after we try some management and treatment plans it does not go away and it persists for more than 8 weeks we do recommend imaging including an mri so in terms of management for right now modified activity at work some short term bed rest very short term though and bed rest is only really recommended if you have severe back pain and muscle spasms and you definitely should not be doing that for more than like 24 to 48 hours and physical activity can help so referral to physical therapy or physiotherapy can help in rehab and they will give you some exercises that you can try at home to kind of strengthen those muscles and then ice and heating packs temporarily can help medications like nsaids can help as well with the inflammation so we will try these things out and then we will continue to follow up yeah did you have any questions or does that sound like an ok plan that sounds like a good plan ok sounds good thank you",
