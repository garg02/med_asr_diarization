It's just always there.\n\nD: OK, does the headache get worse with lying flat? \n\nP: Uh, no, I wouldn't say so, no.\n\nD: OK, and are you feeling any pain down into your neck or into your shoulders or back?\n\nP: No, no. \n\nD: OK.

And, how would you rate it in terms of severity, with 10 being the most severe that you could possibly have and one being not painful at all? How would you rate it?\n\nP: I would say I would give it around a 6 or seven.\n\nD: OK.

And have you been experiencing any other symptoms?\n\nP: Um, just like the brain fog that I was speaking of, you know. I just don't remember, I remember things, but it's it's like I'm doing everything underwater.\n\nD: Oh OK. Have you been uh confused or concerns with your memory?\n\nP: Um, no, I haven't forgotten things. It just feels like I'm really slow at doing things.\n\nD: I see, OK, and how has your energy been? Have you had uh significant fatigue?\n\nP: Yes, I would say I am significantly more tired than I used to be.\n\nD: OK, um, how has your sleep been?\n\nP: My sleep has been pretty normal. I go to bed around the same time, wake up around the same time. Yeah, I'd say that there's no issue there. \n\nD: OK, with this fatigue, have you had any aches and pains?\n\nP: Some muscle aches, I would say mostly in my arms and just my legs, yeah.\n\nD: OK, and have you had a cough?\n\nP: No cough, no.\n\nD: Alright, how about shortness of breath?\n\nP: No shortness of breath either.\n\nD: OK, have you experienced any chest pain?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, how about any period where you felt as though your heart was racing?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and have you have any wheezing?\n\nP: Um no no wheezing.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any loss of taste or smell?\n\nP: Um, no. \n\nD: OK, alright have you noticed any rashes?\n\nP: No rashes either.\n\nD: Alright. And have you had any abdominal pain?\n\nP: No no.\n\nD: OK, have you had any diarrhea? \n\nP: Um no, no diarrhea.\n\nD: OK, um and any constipation?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Alright, and then how about any urinary problems such as painful urination or going frequently?\n\nP: No, no changes.\n\nD: OK. And are you currently sexually active?\n\nP: I am.\n\nD: OK. Could you tell me about your partners or partner?\n\nP: Sure, I I just my husband, um we we don't use protection. But I'm on the birth control pill. \n\nD: OK, and have you had a sexually transmitted infection before?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, and any I guess like vaginal discharge or vaginal discomfort?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK. And, so next just wanted to ask a few questions about your past health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, so no diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Alright, and do you take any medications regularly like prescription or over the counter? \n\nP: I don't.\n\nD: Alright, so it's just the birth control?\n\nP: Oh sorry, yes. Just the birth control pills. \n\nD: Yeah OK, no worries, and any allergies?\n\nP: Just seasonal allergies.\n\nD: OK, and so are immunizations up to date?\n\nP: Yep, they are. \n\nD: Alright, and in in the home, is there anybody who's sick right now?\n\nP: No, no one is sick.\n\nD: Ok, how about at work?\n\nP: I'm I'm a teacher. Um, so I work with a lot of children, but no one that I no one I know of has been sick. \n\nD: OK, um and so have you traveled anywhere recently?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Alright. And do you smoke cigarettes? \n\nP: I don't.\n\nD: OK. Do you smoke marijuana? \n\nP: I don't.\n\nD: Alright. Did you use any recreational drugs?\n\nP: I sometimes take some marijuana edibles, but that's about it.\n\nD: OK, and, do you purchase those at a dispensary?\n\nP: I do.\n\nD: OK, so for one of the Ontario stores?\n\nP: Yes. \n\nD: OK great yeah 'cause you could never be sure where else, what the dosing is, so it's good to get it from the appropriate stores for sure.\n\nP: Right.\n\nD: Do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: I do, I'll have a glass of wine with dinner.\n\nD: OK is this daily?\n\nP: Um most days I would say, maybe like four or five days of the seven days of the week.\n\nD: OK, I see. And has anybody in your family had similar symptoms in the past to what you're having or had any lung conditions in the past?\n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, how about any heart conditions?\n\nP: Um, my father passed away at 75 from a heart attack.\n\nD: OK, and uh, how about any cancers in the family?\n\nP: None that I know of.\n\nD: OK. So I think that was, uh, all of the questions that I wanted to ask on history today. Was there anything else that you thought I was missing or that you wanted to tell me about?\n\nP: No, I don't think so. But, uh, what do you think I have?\n\nD: So with the acuity of your symptoms, starting with the last few days and getting worse, especially with a fever which we now have documented of 38.8 and a kind of feeling, uh, tired with aches and pains and the headache, I am concerned that you have possibly a viral infection, and one of those possibilities could be COVID-19, but also it could be the influenza. It could be something like the common cold, such as adenovirus. So certainly we will do a PCR COVID swab as well as order some general lab work to look for signs of infection, such as a CBC and a white blood cell count. But um, for now we will get those tests ordered. Did you have any questions?\n\nP: OK yeah that sounds great. Do you think I could also have you know, meningitis or something? 'Cause I was reading online on Google and that's the first thing that came up.\n\nD: Oh yeah, you're you're absolutely right, so, um sorry, I we will go ahead and investigate that as well and we might need to do a lumbar puncture or some blood work to look for signs of infection that might be needed to be treated with antibiotics.\n\nP: OK, alright that sounds good, thank you.\n",

conditions in the past no ok so no diabetes high blood pressure anything like that no alright and do you take any medications regularly like prescription or over the counter i do not alright so it is just the birth control 0 sorry yes just the birth control pills yeah ok no worries and any allergies just seasonal allergies ok and so are immunizations up to date yep they are alright and in in the

you traveled anywhere recently no alright and do you smoke cigarettes i do not ok do you smoke marijuana i do not alright did you use any recreational drugs i sometimes take some marijuana edibles but that is about it ok and do you purchase those at a dispensary i do ok so for one of the ontario stores yes ok great yeah cause you could never be sure where else what the dosing is so it is good to get it from the appropriate stores for sure right do you drink alcohol i do i will have a glass of wine with dinner ok is this daily most days i would say maybe like 4 or 5 days of the 7 days of the week ok i see and has anybody in your family had similar symptoms in the past to what you are having or had any lung conditions in the past no nothing like that ok how about any heart conditions my father passed away at 75 from a heart attack ok and how about any cancers in the family none that i know of ok so i think that was all of the questions that i wanted to ask on history today was there anything else that you thought i was missing or that you wanted to tell me about no i do not think so but what do you think i have so with the acuity of your symptoms starting with the last few days and getting worse especially with a fever which we now have documented of 38.8 and a kind of feeling tired with aches and pains and the headache i am concerned that you have possibly a viral infection and one of those possibilities could be covid 19 but also it could be the influenza it could be something like the common cold such as adenovirus so certainly we will do a pcr covid swab as well as order some general lab work to look for signs of infection such as a cbc and a white blood cell count but for now we will get those tests ordered did you have any questions ok yeah that sounds great do you think i could also have you know meningitis or something cause i was reading online on google and that is the 1st thing that came up 0 yeah you are you are absolutely right so sorry i we will go ahead and investigate that as well and we might need to do a lumbar puncture or some blood work to look for signs of infection that might be needed to be treated with antibiotics ok alright that sounds good thank you",
