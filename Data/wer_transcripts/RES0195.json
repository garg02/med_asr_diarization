Alright, yeah, so those are all the questions I had. Do you have any questions for me?\n\nP: Um no, like what what do you think I have and how should I treat it?\n\nD: Yeah, so definitely one thing we need to rule out with the shortness of breath is any viral or viral infection like coronavirus so we will get a test done for you today. However, since this seems to be kind of a chronic issue, been going on for a few months and you're having with the shortness of breath, some other symptoms, the rash below knees, or is what we called erythema nodosum and irritation in your eyes and you have a family history\nof auto immune conditions as well. So sometimes you can get an auto immune disease that affects the lungs, so we need to rule out something like sarcoidosis which can cause fibrosis in your lungs and cause shortness of breath. So just to work that up will get a chest X Ray and also do some inflammatory marker tests like CRP, ESR and some other rheumatological tests as well, and based on what comes back we may have to refer you to a rheumatologist for further management and treatment. Yeah, so let's just do some of those tests 1st, and then we'll go from there. You have any questions?\n\nP: No, that sounds great. Thank you so much.\n\nD: You're welcome, and you may need depending on what we find, steroid treatment today or until you see the rheumatologist. \n\nP: OK.\n\nD: Alright, take care.\n\nP: You too.\n\n",
