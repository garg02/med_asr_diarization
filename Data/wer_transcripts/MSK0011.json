kind of pins and needles sensation tingling or numbness anywhere in your hands no nothing like that ok anything that makes the pain worse or better yeah i tried some anti inflammatories that did help with taking the edge off a little bit and but the pain just came right back and then also like just moving it at all hurts even texting on my phone was really bugging me ok yeah so we definitely you went so you had the fall yesterday or yeah it was yesterday ok ok alright so when did it start hurting did it start hurting right away or has it gotten worse at all yeah it started hurting right away and it is well this morning it is a a bit worse yeah ok do you have any other symptoms at all like fever chills headache anything like that no any dizziness or fainting no ok any diarrhea constipation

conditions you have been diagnosed with yeah i do i have a asthma and i use an orange inhaler daily it has been well controlled i will use i have not used the blue one in awhile ok so it is pretty well controlled yeah and do you take any other medications at all just a multi vitamin ok and vitamin d as well ok alright and have you been hospitalized in the past or had any surgeries yeah i had my my tonsils out and my wisdom teeth out when i was a teenager and or tonsils when i was a kid actually and a c 2nd for my son ok any complications at all with that at all no no every every that was ok ok ok and have you injured your right hand or broken any bones before no i have not ok so this is the 1st injury on your right hand ok and do you have any family history of any medical conditions at

currently yeah i do i i work in a restaurant and so and this will be a difficult for my job coming up with an injured wrist i and hand i i just restarted and i will have to be carrying a lot of different things and so i just hope it is not broken 0 i see yeah it might definitely that is that might be concerning if you know well we will get that check though on x ray and everything but we just need to do a few few more questions and some examination as well how would you describe your living situation right now 0 so i am living on on my own actually in an apartment ok and do you currently smoke no i have i i have never smoked i could not with having asthma so i just stayed away from all of that ok ok and do you drink alcohol yeah i do i i have a couple of bottles of wine per week ok alright a couple of bottles a week so how much would you have in an average day i will probably i guess probably like 2 or 3 glasses of wine a day ok yeah so we definitely recommend for women to limit themselves to an maybe one to 2 max 2 glasses of wine a day as it can have health effects in the future in terms of drinking and on your liver ok and other than that i just had a few questions do any recreational drugs like marijuana no stayed away from that as well ok ok so i am just going to ask you questions about specifically to examine your wrist so you notice so can you are you able to move your wrist around are you able to make a fist i i can but it i can not really bad my thumb and it it it hurts a lot so i can bend my fingers but my thumb is kinda out ok due to the joints in your thumb hurt at all no ok an any pain anywhere else like on your fingers or your elbow no ok and what movement would you say hurts the most i i probably just moving the the wrist like flexing and extending the wrist ok and where the swelling you said is at the base of the thumb right yeah exactly at the base of the thumb on the on the back of the hand there are some bad bruising and swelling there ok is it warm at all to touch no it does not feel warm ok ok and if you press on are you getting any bony pain in that area like if you press on a bone yeah like i mean if i there is one spot that if i press down on it it is like 10 of the 10 pain it hurts really bad if i press at the base of my thumb there ok alright so those are all the questions i had for you today we definitely need to since you are having pain on just tell palpate palpating the area there swelling redness and you did have a fall and you landed on your you caught yourself with your hand there is a common fracture that can happen in those circumstances to your wrist and so we need to do an x ray and we will see if you have a fracture or not but we also need to see if we need to get a cast for you or if if we can manage your injury with a splint or and then based on what we see and if your physical examination we will determine how long you need to be in a cast or splint and then we will go
