In terms of diarrhea, so that started a couple days ago, if you only had diarrhea since then, or have you had like any form stools?\n\nP: No, it's it. It was started more like yesterday and it's really only been diarrhea since. So yeah, like twice last night and then like three to three times this morning. \n\nD: OK. Have you ever had anything like this before?\n\nP: No, I haven't been sick like this before.\n\nD: OK, have you traveled anywhere recently?\n\nP: I just got back from a trip in the US was there for work.\n\nD: OK, and how did you travel there?\n\nP: I I.

Have you been in contact with anyone since coming back that's been sick?\n\nP: Um No. I I, I haven't been in contact with anybody, anybody who's been sick. \n\nD: OK. In addition to the symptoms that you're describing to me, have you had any fevers?\n\nP: I've I started to feel hot this morning.\n\nD: OK, have you had any chills?\n\nP: Nothing like that. \n\nD: Any shakes?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: K night sweats? \n\nP: Um no night sweats.\n\nD: Have you had any cough?\n\nP: Umm no, I haven't really had a cough by my throat's felt a little like scratchy though.\n\nD: OK, scratchy throat OK. Have you had any sore throat?\n\nP: No, I wouldn't really say it's sore, but. Yeah, I mean we just kinda like like itchy.\n\nD: OK. OK, have you noticed any changes to your sense of smell or taste?\n\nP: No, I haven't noticed any changes to those. \n\nD: OK. Mmmm. And you live, do you live alone or with family?\n\nP: I I live with family. I live with my wife and two children.\n\nD: OK there. How are they feeling right now?\n\nP: They were. They've been feeling fine.\n\nD: OK. OK, um, so just in terms of your general health, are there any conditions that you see your family doctor for regularly?\n\nP: I have anxiety and back pain. So, uh, I do get ah. Some hydromorphone for for that. \n\nD: OK \n\nP: For the back pain anyway.\n\nD: OK. Um, and what medications do you take besides the hydromorphone?\n\nP: Uh, uh, Escitalopram. \n\nD: OK. \n\nP: And that we've been working on trying on decreasing the hydromorphone now over the last year. So it's a work in progress though.\n\nD: OK, and have you ever had any surgeries?\n\nP: Uh, yeah on my on my back I was in an accident a few years back. So, um. Well, that's where the pain is from.\n\nD: OK, sad to hear that. Do you have any allergies?\n\nP: Um yeah, to penicillin. I had a hives when I was a kid.\n\nD: OK Um, OK um. Let me see, uh, so in terms of your family history. Do you have any family history of your digestive system problems or respiratory problems? \n\nP: Um Yeah, no one in my families had any problems with their stomach or I haven't heard of any like colon cancer. I mean my my dad had a heart attack when he was in his late 60s, but that's kind of the only thing that I can think happened in my family in terms of health.\n\nD: OK. And it sounds so. It sounds like you live at home with your family, do you? What do you do for work?\n\nP: Yeah, I I work for a tech company so I was going down to meet a potential buyer for one of our products.\n\nD: OK. OK, and just in terms of your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: Um yeah I will have wine. Maybe one or two glasses on on the weekend.\n\nD: OK, do you smoke cigarettes?\n\nP: Umm no but I I used to, I I quit about seven years ago. Yeah, so I quit about seven years ago. \n\nD: Um OK. So do you use any other substances, like cannabis?\n\nP: Um I will have a joint every once in awhile if I with friends, but that's been it's been awhile. 'cause of the pandemic haven't really been hanging out with anybody. \n\nD: Sure. Um OK, I think that's all the questions that I had for you today. So it sounds like there's probably some kind of infection going on. What it is exactly, it's hard to say. There are some cases of COVID-19 that, that are more like GI symptoms then than simply respiratory symptoms. So I think we should probably give you a COVID swab and then we ask that you and everyone in your house self-isolates for a few days until you've got it in a negative result and in a few days without symptoms.\n\nP: OK, that sounds good.\n\nD: So yeah, we'll get that started for you, and otherwise, really, we want to know if it's COVID is just for infection control purposes, but I think that essentially you should be drinking lots of fluids and getting a lot of rest. And it's something that likely should go away on its own. I mean, if things start to become a lot worse and you get really dehydrated and you have fevers that you can't control with Tylenol, then please come back to the emergency Department. But I think in general it will just be kind of supportive treatments for what you're experiencing.\n\nP: OK, that sounds good. I'll get some Gatorade on the way home.\n\nD: Perfect. Actually, don't go into the store. Have someone else get it for you, but.\n\nP: OK will do. Thank you.\n\nD: Have a good have a good day. Thanks for chatting with me.\n\nP: Thank you.\n\n",

of the pandemic have not really been hanging out with anybody sure ok i think that is all the questions that i had for you today so it sounds like there is probably some kind of infection going on what it is exactly it is hard to say there are some cases of covid 19 that that are more like gi symptoms then than simply respiratory symptoms so i think we should probably give you a covid swab and then we ask that you and everyone in your house self isolates for a few days until you have got it in a negative result and in a few days without symptoms ok that sounds good so yeah we will get that started for you and otherwise really we want to know if it is covid is just for infection control purposes but i think that essentially you should be drinking lots of fluids and getting a lot of rest and it is something that likely should go away on its own i mean if things start to become a lot worse and you get really dehydrated and you have fevers that you can not control with tylenol then please come back to the emergency department but i think in general it will just be kind of supportive treatments for what you are experiencing ok that sounds good i will get some gatorade on the way home perfect actually do not go into the store have someone else get it for you but ok will do thank you have a good have a good day thanks for chatting with me thank you",
