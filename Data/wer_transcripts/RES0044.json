Do you have a sore throat?\n\nP: Maybe a little bit this morning, yeah, like at first it just felt dry like I was thinking like, oh it's like you know I need to take a sip of water or something and now it just feels, now it's starting to think, I feel a little bit sore, I think.\n\nD: OK, um is it hard for you to swallow foods or fluids?\n\nP: Oh sorry, could you repeat that?

Um but other than that, no.\n\nD: Um you said you had digestive problems. Did you say it might be Crohn's?\n\nP: Yeah, like I, I've been seeing my family doctor and they they said they thought it might be, um but we don't really know, just like in general, I guess they've been calling it IBS.\n\nD: Oh, I see, OK.

And where do you live?\n\nP: Uh I live in town here.\n\nD: OK, do you live in a house, in an apartment?\n\nP: Um my fianc\u00e9 and I live in a townhouse.\n\nD: In a townhouse, OK, um, any um concerns for like old carpets or mold or asbestos, anything like that?\n\nP: Uh no, it's like a new a new building.\n\nD: OK, OK, and do you think you may have been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?\n\nP: Well, so um, I work uh in like, I work in an office that's attached to a factory um and I, so like I have to actually be there, I haven't been able to work from home. Um and there was someone else in my office that I think was coughing in that, like last week and I I don't know, I questioned it but I I didn't actually get to talk to them and ask them, or like I don't know if they were actually sick or something. So, I might have been, and we wear masks and everything, like we're really good, but I don't know, I feel like the offices aren't like super, like the air flow's not that great.\n\nD: Yeah.\n\nP: So yeah, I think that's another reason I was concerned, that I I feel like some people might have been sick and I didn't really know the whole story.\n\nD: Right, OK, so potentially, from from the workplace then, OK.\n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: And, OK, um have you traveled anywhere recently?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, OK. Well those were all the questions that I had for you today, was there um anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today?\n\nP: Uh not that I can think of.\n\nD: No, OK. So right now it seems like, if I'm going through my differential diagnosis list for you, at the top is, the thing that we have to rule out is Covid, so we'll take a swab and send it off for those PCR results and you'll hear back either tomorrow or the day after, about the results. But in the mean time, and I guess even if the test is negative, um and you're still having symptoms, please do isolate for 14 days. Um and if your symptoms get worse, um like you know, you're having trouble breathing, uh your fever, your temperature is off the charts, um or you're having any sort of neurological symptom, please do um go to the ER and seek out help. Um if it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around at, during this time of year, um, and usually the treatment for that kind of stuff is supportive, so make sure you're staying well hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods, uh you're getting good sleep. Um and if not, and your symptoms, you know you're having a productive cough, um you're really short of breath, uh we can test you to see if you have some sort of bacterial pneumonia, and those are usually treated with antibiotics, so that's kind of the plan right now. Um so we'll just start with that Covid swab for now. How does that sound?\n\nP: Yeah, that that sounds great. That's really what it, like, I I don't feel super sick, I just really wanna know if I have Covid or not.\n\nD: Yeah for sure and I, and I think it's good that you came in.\n\nP: Awesome.\n\nD: Alright, thank you.\n\nP: OK thanks.

    "ref_norm": "what brings you in i just i have i have a cough that i have had for a couple of days and like normally if i had a cough or cold i would just like stay home and rest but just because you know there is like covid i i wanted to make sure like i wanted to get checked out yeah of course that that was a great idea thanks for coming in how long have you had this cough for it is like 2 days like maybe 3 days ago i started to feel like my throat was dry and i was like 0 maybe i need to drink more water or something and then the next day i started like actually coughing ok is it a dry cough or a wet cough yeah it is really dry really dry ok so no sputum no blood that you are bringing up no nothing like that it is just kind of annoying yeah do you have any wheeziness associated with your coughing i do not think so no ok no shortness of breath no no i have been i feel like i have been tired but i do not think it has been actually hard to breathe i just feel overall like really tired ok ok and have you tried anything for the cough like over the counter cough syrup or anything like that like i have i have just been drinking tea and just like tea with honey just to like make it feel better i i did not like take any medicine ok and do you have you noticed that there are any triggers for your cough like the cold or dust or any like environmental triggers i mean i have been just because of covid and stuff i have been staying home ever since i had it ok and do you find that it is constantly there or is it worse during a particular time of day like morning afternoon or evening it is kind of just been there ok and is it getting worse do you think i think so i think like today is worse than yesterday and the day before that it just felt like dry and then and then like the next day i started coughing so yeah ok and have you ever experienced anything like this in the past i mean i have had coughs before this one feels like particularly dry but like it it is not too different than like when i am just like like had a cough in other years ok ok and you mentioned that your throat was also dry do you have a sore throat maybe a little bit this morning yeah like at 1st it just felt dry like i was thinking like 0 it is like you know i need to take a sip of water or something and now it just feels now it is starting to think i feel a little bit sore i think ok is it hard for you to swallow foods or fluids 0 sorry could you repeat that i just missed the last part 0 no worries is it hard for you to swallow food or fluids no it is not hard it is not hard to swallow things ok and then have you had a runny nose or a stuffy nose no not particularly no ok how about any changes to your hearing or vision no no how about changes in smell or taste no that is like a covid thing right like i was hoping because i could still i could still like taste my coffee this morning i was hoping that that means i do not have covid but yeah i do not really know i mean yeah some people have it some people do not i guess people with covid present in different ways yeah yeah do you have a fever at all like when i came in here when the nurse took my temperature she said i had like she said i had a fever i do not have a thermometer at home but like i have been feeling really hot so would probably i have probably been having it for a couple of days ok ok we can take yeah we can take your temperature sorry did you say you already took your temperature today and the nurse took it yeah i do not know what it was but the nurse kept coming in and she said it was a ok ok yeah so yeah we will double check to make sure that you either do or do not have a fever have you experienced any chills or night sweats over the past few days no no ok ok how about any weight loss no like i do not weigh myself regularly but i do not think so ok any changes to your hair or nails or skin like rashes no no ok how about chest pain no no chest pain ok swelling in your limbs no no do you ever feel like your heart is racing no no ok how about how about any dizziness or or fainting spells no like i have been just tired just tired ok yeah i do not i do not i have not fainted or anything ok any headaches no no ok how about confusion or memory loss no i do not think so ok any changes to your bowel habits no no ok so no constipation or diarrhea or blood in your stool yeah exactly ok any changes to your urine no ok any nausea or vomiting no no ok and no abdominal aches no no ok are you otherwise healthy like i have i have like some like digestive problems generally like i have not had any changes to that but they think it might be like crohn is or something but other than that no you said you had digestive problems did you say it might be crohn is yeah like i i have been seeing my family doctor and they they said they thought it might be but we do not really know just like in general i guess they have been calling it ibs 0 i see ok ok i wish i knew exactly but they just said yeah they do not really know ok but there have not been any changes right now 0 yeah i see ok have you ever had any hospitalizations or surgeries no no ok are you on any medications no ok and how about any allergies just pineapple like not any medications or anything pineapple ok are you up to date with all your immunizations yeah yeah ok any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions like my my uncle had a heart attack ok i do not like not my parents ok i see any cancers in the family no ok and do you smoke no no ok how about marijuana no no ok any other recreational drugs no no ok how about alcohol like i drink i do not know maybe i will drink like a bottle of wine on like a weekend like over a whole weekend or something so like i do not know maybe like 3 or 4 drinks over the weekend 3 or 4 drinks a weekend ok yeah something like that sure ok i am not at all like ok so occasionally yeah ok and where do you live i live in town here ok do you live in a house in an apartment my fiance and i live in a townhouse in a townhouse ok any concerns for like old carpets or mold or asbestos anything like that no it is like a new a new building ok ok and do you think you may have been in contact with anyone who has been sick recently well so i work in like i work in an office that is attached to a factory and i so like i have to actually be there i have not been able to work from home and there was someone else in my office that i think was coughing in that like last week and i i do not know i questioned it but i i did not actually get to talk to them and ask them or like i do not know if they were actually sick or something so i might have been and we wear masks and everything like we are really good but i do not know i feel like the offices are not like super like the air flow is not that great yeah so yeah i think that is another reason i was concerned that i i feel like some people might have been sick and i did not really know the whole story right ok so potentially from from the workplace then ok yeah and ok have you traveled anywhere recently no no ok well those were all the questions that i had for you today was there anything that i missed that you wanted to discuss today not that i can think of no ok so right now it seems like if i am going through my differential diagnosis list for you at the top is the thing that we have to rule out is covid so we will take a swab and send it off for those pcr results and you will hear back either tomorrow or the day after about the results but in the mean time and i guess even if the test is -and you are still having symptoms please do isolate for 14 days and if your symptoms get worse like you know you are having trouble breathing your fever your temperature is off the charts or you are having any sort of neurological symptom please do go to the er and seek out help if it is not covid it could be another viral illness that is going around at during this time of year and usually the treatment for that kind of stuff is supportive so make sure you are staying well hydrated you are eating nutritious foods you are getting good sleep and if not and your symptoms you know you are having a productive cough you are really short of breath we can test you to see if you have some sort of bacterial pneumonia and those are usually treated with antibiotics so that is kind of the plan right now so we will just start with that covid swab for now how does that sound yeah that that sounds great that is really what it like i i do not feel super sick i just really want to know if i have covid or not yeah for sure and i and i think it is good that you came in awesome alright thank you ok thanks",
