So that sounds like a great, a great plan. Do you take any other medications?\n\nP: Yes, I take some vitamins and you know, like vitamin D and calcium, but that's it.\n\nD: Ok, any allergies?\n\nP: I'm allergic to penicillin.\n\nD: Ok, have you had antibiotics recently for any reason? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Ok, and are your immunizations up to date?\n\nP: I think so. I think the only thing is I have to see if I'm up to date with my Pneumovax.\n\nD: Ok, great yeah I was wondering about that one so we can look into that certainly. And do you know if you've had the Zoster or the Shingles vaccine? \n\nP: Yes, I had that one.\n\nD: Ok great um, and um next could you I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation?\n\nP: Sure, I live with my husband. We live in a 3 bedroom townhouse. It's a fairly new home.\n\nD: Ok, great. Did you recently move there? \n\nP: Yes we did.\n\nD: Ok, cool. And so there's no concerns with like old carpets or being exposed to kind of like dust or or molds or anything like that in the home? \n\nP: No, nothing like that. \n\nD: Ok, and um, has your husband been sick at all? \n\nP: No, he's been fine.\n\nD: Ok, and do you have any pets in the home? \n\nP: We have a cat.\n\nD: OK, and do you have any allergies to pets?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Alright, um and how do you support yourself financially right now?\n\nP: Um, we're both retired, but we have our RESP savings.\n\nD: Oh excellent, ok, and for your previous occupation, were you exposed to any chemicals or like asbestos or inhalants that you're aware of?\n\nP: Uh no no, nothing like that. \n\nD: Ok, and you smoke cigarettes?\n\nP: I don't.\n\nD: Do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: I have maybe a glass or two glasses of wine over the weekends. \n\nD: Ok, and do you smoke marijuana or use any cannabis products? \n\nP: No, I don't.\n\nD: OK, and how about the use of any other recreational drugs?\n\nP: No, no, nothing like that.\n\nD: Ok and, and has anybody in your family had a heart condition before?\n\nP: My mother passed away when she was 80, she had some valvular issues.\n\nD: Ok um, uh, ok, and has anybody in the family had a heart attack before?\n\nP: No, not that I know of.\n\nD: Alright, and, anybody have any lung conditions?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Alright, and then any cancer that runs in the family?\n\nP: Cancer? No no.\n\nD: Ok um, I think that's all I wanted to cover on the the history today. Was there anything else you'd like to tell me that I was, that I maybe didn't ask about?\n\nP: Uh no, I think you asked me all those other questions, I'm just wondering what do you like, what do you think I have?\n\nD: Yeah, certainly, uh, so it could possibly be something related to the heart. I don't, and sometimes especially people in your age group who have diabetes can have chest pain and symptoms that could be nonspecific. And so we will, we will check that for sure. We'll get an ECG and some lab work with the troponin and also a chest X Ray so that we can investigate for that. And also the chest X Ray could help us look to see if you have something going on in your lungs, like a possible pneumonia or, maybe a viral infection as well, which could include something like COVID-19. So we'll be ordering a PCR nasal swab as well to test for that. And so in the meantime, because we'll be doing that test, it requires self quarantine for 14 days so, if possible, that would mean distancing from your husband in the home as well for that 14 day period, but the results should come back from that test within the next several days. And and sorry, also if it is positive, we will have to notify public health as well so that the appropriate contact tracing can be done.\n\nP: Ok, ok well thank you very much.\n\nD: Now you're very welcome. We'll get the investigations started now.\n\nP: Sure, sounds good.\n",

ok and you use a sliding scale or do you have a regimen you use i have so i have like a long acting and short acting so i just take the long acting before i go to bed and then the short acting before

to penicillin ok have you had antibiotics recently for any reason no ok and are your immunizations up to date i think so i think the only thing is i have to see if i am up to date with my pneumovax ok great yeah i was wondering about that one so we can look into that certainly and do you know if you have had the zoster or the shingles vaccine yes i had that one ok great and next could you i was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation sure i live with my husband we live in a 3 bedroom townhouse it is a fairly new home ok great did you recently move there yes we did ok cool and so there is no concerns with like old carpets or being exposed to kind of like dust or or molds or anything like that in the home no nothing like that ok and has your husband been sick at all no he has been fine ok and do you have any pets in the home we have a cat ok and do you have any allergies to pets no alright and how do you support yourself financially right now we are both retired but we have our resp savings 0 excellent ok and for your previous occupation were you exposed to any chemicals or like asbestos or inhalants that you are aware of no no nothing like that ok and you smoke cigarettes i do not do you drink alcohol i have maybe a glass or 2 glasses of wine over the weekends ok and do you smoke marijuana or use any cannabis products no i do not ok and how about the use of any other recreational drugs no no nothing like that ok and and has anybody in your family had a heart condition before my mother passed away when she was 80 she had some valvular issues ok ok and has anybody in the family had a heart attack before no not that i know of alright and anybody have any lung conditions no alright and then any cancer that runs in the family cancer no no ok i think that is all i wanted to cover on the the history today was there anything else you would like to tell me that i was that i maybe did not ask about no i think you asked me all those other questions i am just wondering what do you like what do you think i have yeah certainly so it could possibly be something related to the heart i do not and sometimes especially people in your age group who have diabetes can have chest pain and symptoms that could be nonspecific and so we will we will check that for sure we will get an ecg and some lab work with the troponin and also a chest x ray so that we can investigate for that and also the chest x ray could help us look to see if you have something going on in your lungs like a possible pneumonia or maybe a viral infection as well which could include something like covid 19 so we will be ordering a pcr nasal swab as well to test for that and so in the meantime because we will be doing that test it requires self quarantine for 14 days so if possible that would mean distancing from your husband in the home as well for that 14 day period but the results should come back from that test within the next several days and and sorry also if it is positive we will have to notify public health as well so that the appropriate contact tracing can be done ok ok well thank you very much now you are very welcome we will get the investigations started now sure sounds good",
