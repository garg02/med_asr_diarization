Um how about um travel?\n\nP: Uh no, I've just been yeah finishing up the the thesis and running. \n\nD: OK, alright, um those were all the questions I had for you, um we'll move on to the physical exam component of this. Um so if you can take a look at both your knees, um do you see any visible redness or swelling in the area?\n\nP: Uh no no swelling or yeah, nothing visible that I can see.\n\nD: OK, so no bruises?\n\nP: Uh no, no no bruises \n\nD: OK. Do you notice any like muscle atrophy, any deformities or skin changes otherwise?\n\nP: No, everything looks looks normal.\n\nD: OK, and if you can just um place your hand just kinda at the top of your, on top of your kneecap on both sides, do you notice any temperature changes from your, uh between your right knee to your left knee?\n\nP: No, no temperature changes, they they feel the same.\n\nD: OK. Um and then when you palpate your knee cap as well as um yeah, just if you could palpate just at the center of your kneecap, do you feel any pain there?\n\nP: No pain over the kneecap, that feels fine.\n\nD: OK. How about when you palpate kind of like the medial ligaments of your kneecap, do you feel any pain there?\n\nP: No, everything on the medial side feels feels normal and fine.\n\nD: How about when you palpate the lateral ligaments of your kneecap?\n\nP: Yeah, the ligaments feel feel OK, on the lateral side though I I do get some pain along the um like above the joint line.\n\nD: Above the joint line?\n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: OK, OK, and how about when you palpate uh that big muscle group on your thighs like the quadriceps?\n\nP: That feels OK, no pain in the muscles.\n\nD: OK, how about like the patellar tendon?\n\nP: Uh no pain there.\n\nD: OK. And then when you go lower below your kneecap, um when you palpate like the top part where the proximal parts of your tibia and fibula are, do you feel any pain there?\n\nP: Uh, yeah, no pain there.\n\nD: OK, and now let's do some um movements with your leg. Um are you sitting down?\n\nP: Uh, yeah, I am.\n\nD: OK, I'm gonna get you to stand up from a sitting position, does that, is that painful?\n\nP: It is, yeah it's, I get a sharp pain if, when doing that. \n\nD: OK yeah, uhm how about when you um sit back down, does that hurt? \n\nP: Um yeah, that hurts too.\n\nD: That hurts too, OK. Um and then how about when you flex your knee inwards, um so that your heel is touching your bum like does that hurt? \n\nP: Uh like I, I'll get up, uh no that doesn't hurt, that feels OK.\n\nD: OK, how about when you extend your knee back out, straighten it all the way?\n\nP: Yeah, that feels OK too if I'm just sitting and doing that, I can um, I can do that OK.\n\nD: OK. Um how about when you, so you're standing and then you uh you abduct your hip so you basically, um you flex your hip but laterally and you kind of bring it upwards so that it's almost, so that your your, the action is like you're uh trying to touch the ceiling.\n\nP: OK yeah I um, it, if, it does feel, it feels like it's kind of pulling um like it feels tight when I do that uh like on that side, it's, I don't get the same sharp pain, but it's uncomfortable.\n\nD: OK, uhm, so I'm gonna try a special test, it's called the Ober test. So can I get you to lie on the side um with the injured knee?\n\nP: Yep.\n\nD: OK, and then I'm gonna get you to flex your knee at 90 degrees and um abduct and extend the hip uh while your thighs maintain in line with your trunk. Um so I'm gonna get you to adduct your thigh, so bring it back towards you, the the median, um as far as possible.\n\nP: Oh yeah, I can't really, it's kind of like stuck out there. It feels really tight if I'm trying to like bring it, bring it back down, my leg almost like floats up if I just leave it there.\n\nD: OK, so that is a positive Ober test. Um OK, so what it sounds like is you, it sounds like you have something called um iliotibial um band syndrome, so ITB syndrome, and basically that happens in um athletes, so depending on your like position, like how much you're using those joints um and like repetitive actions um of like knee flexion extension um kind of triggers that. And to treat it, uh we can try some conservative um things first, so the first thing would be um for you um to have some sort of activity modification to prevent aggravating that joint even more, so you're doing a lot of running, so maybe uh switching to things like swimming um for the time being can help with that. And then other things include ice or heating pads, uh taping and stretching, um and then if the pain is, if the pain uh persists, you can try some like ibuprofen for temporary relief. Um we can talk about other treatments as well, like physiotherapy because um it'll be important to kind of strengthen those muscles around that joint as well as um increase your range of motion, so we can do, we can put in a referral for that. Um and if none of those work, we can also discuss um some other things like ultrasound therapy or like muscle stimulation, um shockwave therapy, and then eventually if none of those other things work, we can discuss surgical management but uh it's rare that it ever gets to that point. Does that sound OK?\n\nP: It does, yeah, thank you so much.\n\nD: OK yeah, no worries.",

like physiotherapy because it will be important to kind of strengthen those muscles around that joint as well as increase your range of motion so we can do we can put in a referral for that and if none of those work we can also discuss some other things like ultrasound therapy or like muscle stimulation shockwave therapy and then eventually if none of those other things work we can discuss surgical management but it is rare that it ever gets to that point does that sound okay it does yeah thank you so much okay yeah no worries",
    "pred_norm_d": "what brings you in okay yeah for sure and you said it started a few weeks ago yeah and so does anything make it worse or better i assume doing any sort of physical activity makes it worse and rest makes it better but how about anything other than that okay and if you were to describe the quality of this pain would you say it is sharp dull achy crampy okay okay and one to 1010 being the worst pain ever how bad is this pain okay all right and have you ever experienced this type of pain before okay okay and you said you were are you still rowing running okay and from when it started to now in the past couple of weeks has it changed like dramatically is it affecting your day to day life okay all right and are you otherwise healthy do you have any symptoms like fevers or chills any weight loss any rashes changes to your vision hearing taste or smell okay how about a cough shortness of breath or wheezing okay how about chest pain heart palpitations okay any changes to your bowel movements okay nausea or vomiting no how about abdominal pain okay any changes to your urine okay how about headaches okay any pain elsewhere on your body okay any numbness or tingling in the area okay how about confusion or memory loss okay any muscle aches around the knee like soreness okay and are you otherwise healthy do you have any long standing medical conditions okay how about hospitalizations or surgeries in the past no okay any medications that you are on okay are you up to date with all your immunizations okay how about allergies do you have any okay any family history of musculoskeletal issues how about heart or lung conditions okay how about autoimmune conditions okay any do you do any smoking okay how about other recreational drugs okay and then where do you live right now and who do you live with okay all right and have you been in contact with anyone sick recently okay how about travel okay all right those are all the questions i have for you we will move on to the physical exam component of this so if you can take a look at both your knees do you see any visible redness or swelling in the area okay so no bruises okay and do you notice any like muscle atrophy any deformities or skin changes otherwise okay and if you can just place your hand just kind of at the top of your on top of your kneecap on both sides do you notice any temperature changes from your between your right knee to your left knee okay and then when you palpate your knee cap as well as yeah just if you can palpate just at the center of your kneecap do you feel any pain there okay how about when you palpate kind of like the medial ligaments of your kneecap do you feel any pain there how about when you palpate the lateral ligaments of your kneecap above the joint line okay okay and how about when you palpate that big muscle group on your thighs like the quadriceps okay how about like the patellar tendon okay and then when you go lower below your kneecap when you palpate like the top part or the proximal parts of your tibia and fibula do you feel any pain there okay and now let us do some movements with your leg are you sitting down okay i am going to get you to stand up from a sitting position does that is that painful okay yeah how about when you sit back down does that hurt that hurts too okay and then how about when you like does that hurt like i i will get up okay how about when you extend your knee back okay okay how about when you so you are standing and then you you abduct your hip so you basically you flex your hip laterally and you kind of bring it upwards so that it is almost so that you are the action is like you are trying to touch the ceiling okay so i am going to try a special test it is called the ober test so can i get you to lie on the side with the injured knee okay and then i am going to get you to flex your knee at 90 degrees and abduct and extend the hip while your thigh is maintained in line with your trunk so i am going to get you to add duct your thigh so bring it back towards you the median as far as possible okay so that is a positive ober test okay so what it sounds like is you have it sounds like you have something called iliotibial band syndrome so itb syndrome and basically that happens in athletes so depending on your like position like how much you are using those joints and like repetitive actions of like knee flexion extension kind of triggers that and to treat it we can try some conservative things 1st so the 1st thing would be for you to have some sort of activity modification to prevent aggravating that joint even more so you are doing a lot of running so maybe switching to things like swimming for the time being can help with that and then other things include ice or heating pads taping and stretching and then if the pain is if the pain persists you can try some like ibuprofen for temporary relief we can talk about other treatments as well like physiotherapy because it will be important
