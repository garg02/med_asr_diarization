    "ref": "D: I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what brought you in.\n\nP: Yeah, so like a couple months ago I was in the office and they told me that I have asthma like I had it when I was a little kid and I thought I grew out of it, but apparently not, or like it came back or something so. Yeah, so they just told me to come back today. I don't really have like any issues.\n\nD: OK, So what what brought on the appointment in the summer time or a couple of months ago?\n\nP: Uh. So like I have gym class at school and my teacher justalways thought that like should be able to run faster like I'm looking good athlete but I just couldn't go much faster and I was like saying I can't really breathe when I'm running that fast. And then you know my mom was like you should probably go. We should probably make an appointment.\n\nD: OK, and uh, when you're exercising or in gym class, do you get short of breath or do you find that you have difficulty breathing?\n\nP: Yeah, yeah, like I will if I if I try to run fast. Like I, kinda can't breathe anymore. So I kind of stop or go slower.\n\nD: OK, and how long does it take for the breathing difficulty to go away?\n\nP: If I stop doing like the thing I'm doing it, I I don't know not very long like couple of minutes. \n\nD: OK, and uh, does this happen in any other settings?\n\nP: Oh, like sometimes when it's really cold outside, I'll go out and like it. My chest feels tight and just feel like I can't breathe and kind of sucks like my girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow Angels and stuff and I couldn't do it. Oh, another time, like I went to my friends house and they had like a bunch of cats I I felt like I got wheezy sound and I felt like that time it took longer for for the breathing to get easier like I had to leave.\n\nD: OK, so you've noticed changes to to your breathing sounds? Like you've had noisy breathing before?\n\nP: Yeah, mostly just with the cat.\n\nD: OK.\n\nP: We don't have a cat at my house, so I didn't really think anything of it. And then I went to my friends house who had a bunch of cats and. Then at that time, I could actually hear it.\n\nD: OK, and have you had a cough?\n\nP: Uh, no, I don't think so.\n\nD: OK, And. Were there anything, was there anything that you tried besides the rest to make those symptoms go away?\n\nP: Like I have the, uh um inhaler that the doctor gave me last time. So yeah, like I've been using it in gym class now.\n\nD: OK, how many days per week are you using that?\n\nP: Well, I'm a little confused now because. I the 1 supposed to use, like every day a couple times, and then there was a different one that I thought it was only supposed to be used if the other one didn't work. But now the nurse just told me that I'm supposed to use them both, so I only got the one at the pharmacy so I don't really I don't really know. I feel like a bit confused now, but I always use the 1 supposed to be like 2 times a day, the one that starts with an \"s\", um but sometimes I just do it once a day if I forget the second one.\n\nD: OK, well um we can definitely clarify the confusion about the medications today. Sometimes, for steroid medications, those ones are required to be used daily in order to get the maximal benefit, and so will take a look at your medications and see if one of those has a steroid component in it and say and how often you're needing it. Have you been having any episodes of shortness of breath at night time?\n\nP: Oh no. No, mostly like gym class like I said.\n\nD: OK. And have you had any other associated symptoms?\n\nP: Uh. I don't think so. Like what do you mean?\n\nD: Um, so anything like like allergies like runny nose or really itchy eyes with maybe some like um tearing?\n\nP: When I was around the cats, yeah. But not the other times.\n\nD: OK. And do you ever have any rashes on your skin or or really itchy skin?\n\nP: When I was a kid but not really now.\n\nD: OK, and how about any nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK. Any infectious symptoms overall?\n\nP: Ahh, I don't I don't think so.\n\nD: OK, any urinary problems?\n\nP: Uh, like. No, no.\n\nD: OK. Bowel problems?\n\nP: uh no, no. No, that's all good.\n\nD: OK um. And, uh, any fevers or chills?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, and then how about, uh, have you been having any night sweats?\n\nP: What's that?\n\nD: So, uh, overnight when you're sleeping you wake up with either your like pajamas drenched, or your your sheets drenched drenched from sweating.\n\nP: Oh no.\n\nD: OK. \n\nP: Um not that. \n\nD: OK. So I just wanted to ask a few questions about your past health. Have you been, so you mentioned asthma. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?\n\nP: No, no that's it.\n\nD: OK, um, and any recent hospitalizations?\n\nP: Like I broke my leg years ago but like that was just like really fast.\n\nD: OK, and any surgeries?\n\nP: Uh. Just like my wisdom teeth.\n\nD: OK, and any medications besides it like that, including the inhalers?\n\nP: Nothing else, just. Just those things and my mom makes me take a vitamin.\n\nD: OK, and any allergies?\n\nP: What I don't know like not that I thought, but maybe like cats.\n\nD: OK, and do you have any like seasonal allergies? Do you find like in the spring or fall time or even summer that you get um like dry eyes or really itchy\neyes or runny nose?\n\nP: Yeah, I just thought like I had a cold, but I guess like I usually feel like that in the springtime.\n\nD: OK. And, uh, are immunizations up to date?\n\nP: I think so, like I've had all the stuff that I'm supposed to. I think I don't know the names of everything.\n\nD: OK, and so I actually wanted to ask a few questions about personal and kind of lifestyle habits. But first I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation?\n\nP: You know, like I live with my mom and Dad and I like my little brother.\n\nD: OK. \n\nP: Yeah. \n\nD: OK, and um, where do you go to school?\n\nP: Um to to the. The school, um like high school down the road.\n\nD: OK and in what grade now?\n\nP: And, I'm in Grade 11.\n\nD: OK, and what types of like hobbies or kind of activities are you interested in?\n\nP: I like I like playing video games, I was really wanting to join the Marines and I was really trying to get into that stuff, but then I heard like you can't when you have asthma. Oh so I I kinda wanna know bout that like is that gonna stop me from doing that?\n\nD: Yeah, so it's something that we will look into today. I'm. I'm not too sure what the details are regarding that information, but thank you for bringing that up and we'll be for sure to look into that together. And that reminded me of a question I wanted to ask earlier and so have you had pulmonary function tests done before?\n\nP: Uh, what is that?\n\nD: So essentially they'll have you kind of breathing into a tube where you'll have periods where you'll maximally inhale and then maximally exhale as quickly as you can, and you'll do different types of breathing movements so that it gets measured on a on a device.\n\nP: Is that like when you breathe in that the tube? \n\nD: Yeah, exactly.\n\nP: Yeah, like the last time I was here like couple months ago I did that and it said that, she said that my asthma was back.\n\nD: OK. Right, thank you for clarifying. And so, so for the last few questions about. And your personal habits. I was wondering. I understand that people in your age group might experience with smoking or or alcohol. Do any of your friends do that?\n\nP: I mean, sometimes we'll drink beer like at parties on the weekend. I don't, I don't drink a lot.\n\nD: OK, and can you tell me a little bit about your diet?\n\nP: Sorry I missed that.\n\nD: Just wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your diet?\n\nP: Oh, well my mom always like makes me a lunch like I'll have like a sandwich for lunch with like you know ham and cheese or something. I'll usually have like cereal for breakfast and my mom makes dinner. It's usually like meat like potatoes and vegetables or something. I think it's like pretty normal.\n\nD: OK, and are you currently sexually active?\n\nP: Uh. Like I have a girlfriend. Just with her. Uh, like just recently. Yeah we started.\n\nD: OK, and do you use a condom?\n\nP: Yeah, yeah. \n\nD: Every time or sometimes?\n\nP: Oh yeah, every time. It's not doing that many times, but yeah.\n\nD: OK, great and um have you had any other partners?\n\nP: No, no like I had made out with other people before, but this is like the first one.\n\nD: OK, but have you had a sexually transmitted infection before?\n\nP: Uh no. \n\nD: OK, and I know this question might seem a little bit invasive, but it's important to ask everybody. Have you had any thoughts of hurting or harming yourself?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK. \n\nP: No I haven't.\n\nD: OK, great um. And in your family, has anybody ever had any of these similar symptoms before?\n\nP: Like may my dad, I think he maybe had asthma when he was younger, but like he doesn't really have it now.\n\nD: OK, and any allergies that run in the family?\n\nP: Mmmm, like my dad also really. Dad gets like a runny nose in the spring. So yeah, I think that's allergies. \n\nD: OK. um. So overall, it's it's sounding like you been having this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing episodes that you're saying that it's made worse when you're exercising, out in the cold, and then around pets. And sometimes when the season changes as well and in the spring and so and then the recent diagnosis on pulmonary function tests a few months ago. So I think it would be important to clear up the medications today and try to get that better organized moving forward because it sounds like you're still pretty symptomatic with needing to use them daily currently. And so will look into that and then also the question about the Marines. Uh, interest with asthma.\n\nP: Yeah, thank you. I really wanna know that like that was my plan and now I'm like kinda worried I can do that.\n\nD: Excellent.\n\nP: K thank you.\n\n",

    "pred_norm_d": "i was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what brought you in ok so what brought on the appointment in the summertime or a couple of months ago ok and when you are exercising or in gym class do you get short of breath or do you find that you have difficulty breathing ok and how long does it take for the breathing difficulty to go away ok and does this happen in any other settings ok so you have noticed changes to your breathing sounds like you have had noisy breathing before ok and have you had a cough ok and was there anything that you tried besides the rest to make those symptoms go away ok how many days per week are you using that ok well we can definitely clarify the confusion about the medications today sometimes for steroid medications those ones are required to be used daily in order to get the maximal benefit and so we will take a look at your medications and see if one of those has a steroid component in it and how often you are needing it have you been having any episodes of shortness of breath at nighttime ok and have you had any other associated symptoms so anything like allergies like runny nose or really itchy eyes with maybe some like eye tearing ok and do you ever have any rashes on your skin or really itchy skin ok and how about any nausea or vomiting ok any infectious symptoms overall ok any urinary problems ok any bowel problems ok and any fevers or chills ok and then how about having any night sweats so overnight when you are sleeping you would wake up with either your pajamas drenched or your sheets drenched from sweating ok so i just wanted to ask a few questions about your past health have you been so you mentioned asthma have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions ok and any recent hospitalizations ok any surgeries ok and any medications besides like that including the inhalers ok and any allergies ok and do you have any seasonal allergies you find like in the spring or fall time or even summer that you get some like dry eyes or really itchy eyes or runny nose ok and are your immunizations up to date ok and so actually just wanted to ask a few questions about personal and kind of lifestyle habits but 1st i was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation ok and where do you go to school ok and what grade now ok and what types of hobbies or kind of activities are you interested in yeah so something that we will look into today i am not too sure what the details are but thank you for bringing that up and we will be sure to look into that together and that reminded me of a question i wanted to ask earlier and so have you had pulmonary function tests done before so essentially they will have you kind of breathing into a tube where you will have periods where you will maximally inhale and then maximally exhale as quickly as you can and you will do different types of breathing movements so that it gets measured on a device yeah exactly ok thank you for clarifying and so for the last few questions about your personal habits i was wondering i understand that people in your age group might experiment with smoking or alcohol do any of your friends do that ok and can you tell me a little bit about your diet sorry i missed that i was just wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your diet ok and are you currently sexually active ok and do you use a condom every time or sometimes ok great and have you had any other partners ok have you had a sexually transmitted infection before ok and i know this question might seem a little bit invasive but it is important to ask everybody have you had any thoughts of hurting or harming yourself ok and in your family has anybody ever had any of these similar symptoms before ok and any allergies that run in the family ok so overall it is sounding like you have been having this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing episodes that you are saying that it is made worse when you are exercising out in the cold and then around pets and sometimes when the season changes as well in the spring and so and then with a recent diagnosis on pulmonary function tests a few months ago so i think it would be important to clear up the medications today and try to get that better organized moving forward because it sounds like you are still pretty symptomatic with needing to use them daily currently and so we will look into that and then also the question about the marine interest with asthma excellent ok thank you",
    "pred_norm_p": "yeah so like a couple of months ago i was in the office and they told me that i have asthma like i had it when i was a little kid and i thought i grew out of it but apparently not or like it came back or something so yeah so they just told me to come back today i do not really have like any issues so i have gym class at school and my teacher just always thought that i should be able to run faster like i am a good athlete but i just could not go much faster and i was like saying i can not really breathe when i am running that fast and then you know my mom was like you should probably go we should probably make an appointment yeah yeah like i if i if i try to run fast like i kind of can not breathe anymore so i kind of stop or go slower like if i stop doing like the thing i am doing i do not know not very long like a couple of minutes like sometimes when it is really cold outside i will go out and like my chest feels tight and i feel like i can not breathe and kind of sucks like my girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow angels and stuff and i could not do it 0 and another time like i went to my friend is house and they had like a bunch of cats i felt like like that wheezy sound and i felt like that time it took longer for the breathing to get easier like i had to leave yeah mostly just with the cat ok we do not have a cat at my house so i did not really think anything of it and then i went to my friend is house who had a bunch of cats and then at that time i could actually hear it no i do not think so like i have the inhaler that the doctor gave me last time so so yeah like i have been using that in gym class now well i am a little confused now because i the one i am supposed to use like every day a couple of times and then there was a different one that i thought it was only supposed to be used if the other one did not work but now the nurse just told me that i am supposed to use them both so i only got the one at the pharmacy so i do not really i do not really know i feel like a bit confused now but i always use the one supposed to be like 2 times a day the one that starts with an f but sometimes i just do it once a day if i forget the 2nd one no no mostly like gym class like i said i do not think so like what do you mean when i was around the cat yeah but not the other time when i was a kid but not really now no i do not i do not think so like no no i know no that is all good no what is that 0 no ok not that no no that is it like i broke my leg a few years ago but like that was just like really fast just like my wisdom teeth nothing else just just those things my mom makes me take a vitamin well i do not know like not that i thought but maybe like cats yeah i always just thought like i had a cold but i guess like i usually feel like that in the springtime i think so like i have had all the stuff that i am supposed to i think i do not know the names of everything yeah like i live with my mom and dad and like my little brother to the school like high school down the road i am in grade 11 like i like playing video games i was really wanting to join the marines and i was really trying to get into that stuff but then i heard like you can not when you have asthma so i kind of want to know about that like is that going to stop me from doing that what is that 0 like is that like when you breathe in the tube yeah like the last time i was here like a couple of months ago i did that and she said that my asthma was back i mean sometimes we will drink beer like at parties on the weekend i do not drink a lot 0 well my mom always like makes me a lunch like i will have like a sandwich for lunch with like you know ham and cheese or something we usually have like cereal for breakfast and my mom makes dinner it is usually like meat and like potatoes and vegetables or something and i think it is like pretty normal like i have a girlfriend like just with her like just recently yeah we started yeah 0 yeah every time it is not that many times but yeah no no like i have made out with other people before but this is like the 1st one no no like my dad i think he maybe had asthma when he was younger but like he does not really have it now like my dad also my dad gets like a runny nose in the spring so yeah i think that is allergies yeah thank you i really want to know that like that was my plan and now i am like kind of worried i can do that",
    "ref_norm": "i was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what brought you in yeah so like a couple months ago i was in the office and they told me that i have asthma like i had it when i was a little kid and i thought i grew out of it but apparently not or like it came back or something so yeah so they just told me to come back today i do not really have like any issues ok so what what brought on the appointment in the summer time or a couple of months ago so like i have gym class at school and my teacher justalways thought that like should be able to run faster like i am looking good athlete but i just could not go much faster and i was like saying i can not really breathe when i am running that fast and then you know my mom was like you should probably go we should probably make an appointment ok and when you are exercising or in gym class do you get short of breath or do you find that you have difficulty breathing yeah yeah like i will if i if i try to run fast like i kinda can not breathe anymore so i kind of stop or go slower ok and how long does it take for the breathing difficulty to go away if i stop doing like the thing i am doing it i i do not know not very long like couple of minutes ok and does this happen in any other settings 0 like sometimes when it is really cold outside i will go out and like it my chest feels tight and just feel like i can not breathe and kind of sucks like my girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow angels and stuff and i could not do it 0 another time like i went to my friends house and they had like a bunch of cats i i felt like i got wheezy sound and i felt like that time it took longer for for the breathing to get easier like i had to leave ok so you have noticed changes to to your breathing sounds like you have had noisy breathing before yeah mostly just with the cat ok we do not have a cat at my house so i did not really think anything of it and then i went to my friends house who had a bunch of cats and then at that time i could actually hear it ok and have you had a cough no i do not think so ok and were there anything was there anything that you tried besides the rest to make those symptoms go away like i have the inhaler that the doctor gave me last time so yeah like i have been using it in gym class now ok how many days per week are you using that well i am a little confused now because i the one supposed to use like every day a couple times and then there was a different one that i thought it was only supposed to be used if the other one did not work but now the nurse just told me that i am supposed to use them both so i only got the one at the pharmacy so i do not really i do not really know i feel like a bit confused now but i always use the one supposed to be like 2 times a day the one that starts with an s but sometimes i just do it once a day if i forget the 2nd one ok well we can definitely clarify the confusion about the medications today sometimes for steroid medications those ones are required to be used daily in order to get the maximal benefit and so will take a look at your medications and see if one of those has a steroid component in it and say and how often you are needing it have you been having any episodes of shortness of breath at night time 0 no no mostly like gym class like i said ok and have you had any other associated symptoms i do not think so like what do you mean so anything like like allergies like runny nose or really itchy eyes with maybe some like tearing when i was around the cats yeah but not the other times ok and do you ever have any rashes on your skin or or really itchy skin when i was a kid but not really now ok and how about any nausea or vomiting no ok any infectious symptoms overall ahh i do not i do not think so ok any urinary problems like no no ok bowel problems no no no that is all good ok and any fevers or chills no ok and then how about have you been having any night sweats what is that so overnight when you are sleeping you wake up with either your like pajamas drenched or your your sheets drenched drenched from sweating 0 no ok not that ok so i just wanted to ask a few questions about your past health have you been so you mentioned asthma have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions no no that is it ok and any recent hospitalizations like i broke my leg years ago but like that was just like really fast ok and any surgeries just like my wisdom teeth ok and any medications besides it like that including the inhalers nothing else just just those things and my mom makes me take a vitamin ok and any allergies what i do not know like not that i thought but maybe like cats ok and do you have any like seasonal allergies do you find like in the spring or fall time or even summer that you get like dry eyes or really itchy yeah i just thought like i had a cold but i guess like i usually feel like that in the springtime ok and are immunizations up to date i think so like i have had all the stuff that i am supposed to i think i do not know the names of everything ok and so i actually wanted to ask a few questions about personal and kind of lifestyle habits but 1st i was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation you know like i live with my mom and dad and i like my little brother ok yeah ok and where do you go to school to to the the school like high school down the road ok and in what grade now and i am in grade 11 ok and what types of like hobbies or kind of activities are you interested in i like i like playing video games i was really wanting to join the marines and i was really trying to get into that stuff but then i heard like you can not when you have asthma 0 so i i kinda want to know bout that like is that going to stop me from doing that yeah so it is something that we will look into today i am i am not too sure what the details are regarding that information but thank you for bringing that up and we will be for sure to look into that together and that reminded me of a question i wanted to ask earlier and so have you had pulmonary function tests done before what is that so essentially they will have you kind of breathing into a tube where you will have periods where you will maximally inhale and then maximally exhale as quickly as you can and you will do different types of breathing movements so that it gets measured on a on a device is that like when you breathe in that the tube yeah exactly yeah like the last time i was here like couple months ago i did that and it said that she said that my asthma was back ok right thank you for clarifying and so so for the last few questions about and your personal habits i was wondering i understand that people in your age group might experience with smoking or or alcohol do any of your friends do that i mean sometimes we will drink beer like at parties on the weekend i do not i do not drink a lot ok and can you tell me a little bit about your diet sorry i missed that just wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your diet 0 well my mom always like makes me a lunch like i will have like a sandwich for lunch with like you know ham and cheese or something i will usually have like cereal for breakfast and my mom makes dinner it is usually like meat like potatoes and vegetables or something i think it is like pretty normal ok and are you currently sexually active like i have a girlfriend just with her like just recently yeah we started ok and do you use a condom yeah yeah every time or sometimes 0 yeah every time it is not doing that many times but yeah ok great and have you had any other partners no no like i had made out with other people before but this is like the 1st one ok but have you had a sexually transmitted infection before no ok and i know this question might seem a little bit invasive but it is important to ask everybody have you had any thoughts of hurting or harming yourself no ok no i have not ok great and in your family has anybody ever had any of these similar symptoms before like may my dad i think he maybe had asthma when he was younger but like he does not really have it now ok and any allergies that run in the family mmmm like my dad also really dad gets like a runny nose in the spring so yeah i think that is allergies ok so overall it is it is sounding like you been having this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing episodes that you are saying that it is made worse when you are exercising out in the cold and then around pets and sometimes when the season changes as well and in the spring and so and then the recent diagnosis on pulmonary function tests a few months ago so i think it would be important to clear up the medications today and try to get that better organized moving forward because it sounds like you are still pretty symptomatic with needing to use them daily currently and so will look into that and then also the question about the marines interest with asthma yeah thank you i really want to know that like that was my plan and now i am like kinda worried i can do that excellent k thank you",
