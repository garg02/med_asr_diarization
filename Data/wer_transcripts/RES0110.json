Yep, Yep uh so.\n\nP: OK. \n\nD: Well, you will be in the hospital, so yes you do. We will be we will be doing a Covid test, but that's a really good point um uh because your symptoms do overlap with Covid symptoms um we will also uh have you in an isolated room away from other patients until your Covid swabs are back and we know whether um, yeah, we'll follow the guidelines um put forth by the public health. \n\nP: OK, sure.",
