Do you have any allergies?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, so you said that these symptoms started yesterday and they were quite sudden, uh, was there anything that you were doing yesterday or the day before that was different or unusual?\n\nP: Well, yeah, I mean yesterday I, or, yeah, I had a bit more to drink than, uh, usual, more alcohol I mean. So, I mean, could that have something to do with it? I'm not sure.\n\nD: It could potentially. Did you, were you, were you drunk and did you pass out?\n\nP: Yeah, I think so. My, my friends, uh yeah, that's what my friends were, were saying anyway.\n\nD: OK, and uh, talking about alcohol, how much do you usually drink?\n\nP: I usually, like, like four to six beers a day, but uh, yeah, yesterday was certainly more than that.\n\nD: Have you considered reducing the amount of alcohol you drink? Has it affected you in any way?\n\nP: I mean I, I'm retired now so, uhm, I don't know, I, I feel like it's been fine maybe, uh, I feel like it's been fine.\n\nD: OK, OK, I suppose we could talk a little bit more about that later if you want uhm, as four to six beers is quite a lot actually, and it can affect your health in certain ways, but we can, we can chat more about that later.\n\nP: OK.\n\nD: And, uh, do you smoke?\n\nP: Yeah, I smoke, uhm, a half a pack of cigarettes per day. It was well over a pack before, so I've cut down a little bit.\n\nD: No, that's great. OK, do you plan on cutting it down further or do you wanna stay right there?\n\nP: Yeah I have been, have been trying, just too, too darn expensive these days, so, been trying to cut back.\n\nD: Yeah, yeah, that's fair, alright. What about marijuana? Do you consume marijuana?\n\nP: No, I don't.\n\nD: Any recreational drugs?\n\nP: Nope.\n\nD: Alright, do you have any family history of any medical problems?\n\nP: Uh yeah, my, my father had, uh, he ended up having liver disease actually, he passed away from that I think. And he had heart problems too. He was a lifelong smoker and didn't really, didn't really take care of himself.\n\nD: Hmm, I see. Do you, do you have a family doctor?\n\nP: Uh, I do. I haven't seen my family doctor in a number of years now though.\n\nD: Yeah, well, you know it's, it's a good idea to see your family doctor on a regular basis, specially when you're getting older, because sometimes you might need changes in your medications, or there might be checkups or screenings that they might want to do. It's for your own benefit, you know, maybe even just seeing them once a year would be a good idea. I would definitely recommend that you book an appointment with them just for a checkup in the next couple of weeks. Is there a reason why you don't see your family doctor too often?\n\nP: I just haven't been, uhm, sick and I've been able to, to refill my prescriptions, mostly from just calling in, so.\n\nD: OK, ok, I see, uhm, alright, and do you live alone or do you live with other people?\n\nP: Yeah, I live with my wife.\n\nD: OK, alright, and are you able to take care of things like groceries or finances, or shoveling snow or cleaning the house, or do you need any assistance with those sort of household activities?\n\nP: Yeah, we moved, uhm, actually into an apartment last year. It's made it a lot easier in terms of the housework and that sort of thing. But I've been able to, uhm, I do the the grocery shopping and share the the chores around, around the house. I do, I'll use a cane sometimes. I, I injured my knee a number of years ago, but other than that, things are OK.\n\nD: OK, OK, good to hear. That reminds me, have you had any surgeries in the past?\n\nP: Just on my, my left knee. I had a left knee replacement a few years ago.\n\nD: OK alright and have you any had, had any hospitalizations?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, alright, uhm, so sounds like you've had a day of this wet cough with the, this, a bad smelling sort of sputum that's, that's yellowish green in color, and you've also had difficulties breathing for the past twelve hours, uh, so much so that you can't even go out to get mail and your hearts been racing. It's possible that while you were drunk that you might have, and given that you have acid reflux, that you might have accidentally have something go inside your breathing tube from, from your mouth or something that came up from your stomach and sometimes when that happens, food items can or other things can get lodged in your lungs and can become, uhm, can attract bacteria to, uh, to replicate and cause a bacterial infection, so it's possible that, that's what happened But it could also be a viral pneumonia or a viral infection in your chest. we'll get a chest x-ray done, we'll have some labs done as well, and we'll likely start some antibiotics. Have you recently been on any antibiotics?\n\nP: No, I haven't.\n\nD: And you don't have any allergies to any, correct?\n\nP: Correct.\n\nD: Alright, OK, we'll also do a physical exam just to give a listen to your, to your lungs and see how they're doing and then go from there. Do you have any questions for me?\n\nP: No, that sounds good. Thank you.",

tell me about your past medical history do you have any medical conditions yeah i have uhm high blood pressure i also have acid reflux so gerd i think think it is called yeah and uhm high cholesterol as well ok ok and i have also been had issues with anxiety in the past as well in terms of medications are you taking any yeah i take uhm an ace inhibitor statin uhm and medication for my stomach i think like pantoprazole ok and how well has your gerd been controlled it kind of it bugs me most days its not so bad i mean sometimes i will get a little bit of heartburn and acid in the in my mouth but it depends on what i eat so i really try to stay away from some some foods so the ppi has not completely curbed the the acid reflux you still get it yeah i still get it it is definitely helped though it was a lot worse before starting it i have been on been on it now for a few years ok and as for your anxiety do you ever get panic attacks no i have not had any any panic attacks ok alright do you have any allergies no ok so you said that these symptoms started yesterday and they were quite sudden was there anything that you were doing yesterday or the day before that was different or unusual well yeah i mean yesterday i or yeah i had a bit more to drink than usual more alcohol i mean so i mean could that have something to do with it i am not sure it could potentially did you were you were you drunk and did you pass out yeah i think so my my friends yeah that is what my friends were were saying anyway ok and talking about alcohol how much do you usually drink i usually like like 4 to 6 beers a day but yeah yesterday was certainly more than that have you considered reducing the amount of alcohol you drink has it affected you in any way i mean i i am retired now so uhm i do not know i i feel like it has been fine maybe i feel like it has been fine ok ok i suppose we could talk a little bit more about that later if you want uhm as 4 to 6 beers is quite a lot actually and it can affect your health in certain ways but we can we can chat more about that later ok and do you smoke yeah i smoke uhm a half a pack of cigarettes per day it was well over a pack before so i have cut down a little bit no that is great ok do you plan on cutting it down further or do you want to stay right there yeah i have been have been trying just too too darn expensive these days so been trying to cut back yeah yeah that is fair alright what about marijuana do you consume marijuana no i do not any recreational drugs nope alright do you have any family history of any medical problems yeah my my father had he ended up having liver disease actually he passed away from that i think and he had heart problems too he was a lifelong smoker and did not really did not really take care of himself i see do you do you have a family doctor i do i have not seen my family doctor in a number of years now though yeah well you know it is it is a good idea to see your family doctor on a regular basis specially when you are getting older because sometimes you might need changes in your medications or there might be checkups or screenings that they might want to do it is for your own benefit you know maybe even just seeing them once a year would be a good idea i would definitely recommend that you book an appointment with them just for a checkup in the next couple of weeks is there a reason why you do not see your family doctor too often i just have not been uhm sick and i have been able to to refill my prescriptions mostly from just calling in so ok ok i see uhm alright and do you live alone or do you live with other people yeah i live with my wife ok alright and are you able to take care of things like groceries or finances or shoveling snow or cleaning the house or do you need any assistance with those sort of household activities yeah we moved uhm actually into an apartment last year it is made it a lot easier in terms of the housework and that sort of thing but i have been able to uhm i do the the grocery shopping and share the the chores around around the house i do i will use a cane sometimes i i injured my knee a number of years ago but other than that things are ok ok ok good to hear that reminds me have you had any surgeries in the past just on my my left knee i had a left knee replacement a few years ago ok alright and have you any had had any hospitalizations no ok alright uhm so sounds like you have had a day of this wet cough with the this a bad smelling sort of sputum that is that is yellowish green in color and you have also had difficulties breathing for the past 12 hours so much so that you can not even go out to get mail and your hearts been racing it is possible that while you were drunk that you might have and given that you have acid reflux that you might have accidentally have something go inside your breathing tube from from your mouth or something that came up from your stomach and sometimes when that happens food items can or other things can get lodged in your lungs and can become uhm can attract bacteria to to replicate and cause a bacterial infection so it is possible that that is what happened but it could also be a viral pneumonia or a viral infection in your chest we will get a chest x ray done we will have some labs done as well and we will likely start some antibiotics have you recently been on any antibiotics no i have not and you do not have any allergies to any correct correct alright ok we will also do a physical exam just to give a listen to your to your lungs and see how they are doing and then go from there do you have any questions for me no that sounds good thank you",
