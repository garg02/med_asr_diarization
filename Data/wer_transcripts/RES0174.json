Just like yeah, my face is like sweating, and my neck.\n\nD: OK. Yeah, Um, OK, and How is your weight been recently? Any weight gain or loss?\n\nP: Yeah, I've gained quite a bit of weight since the pandemic started. Yeah, gained about 10 pounds. \n\nD: OK, any changes to your diet or appetite?\n\nP: Oh yeah, I've been eating quite a bit, been baking a lot at home. \n\nD: OK.

And have you had depression or anxiety in the past?\n\nP: Um I've been diagnosed with depression.\n\nD: OK. And have you had panic attacks before?\n\nP: No, but do you think that's what's going on?\n\nD: Potentially, it certainly can't rule out. Inorganic cause meaning something going on, otherwise just yet we might need to do some physical exam and some investigations first, but it certainly could be related to that. With all of the stressors that are going on. And so you had a low mood. Have you had any periods in your life where you felt really energetic, like you didn't need any sleep, you're really talkative, you had all the energy in the world.\n\nP: I wish, no, I've never really felt that way,\n\nD: OK. And have you had any concerns with eating disorders in the past?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Alright. And then you mentioned, even diagnosed with depression, if you had, are you have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, are you on any medications right now?\n\nP: No, I was doing pretty well. I used to have these episodes of depression when I was younger as a teenager and they kind of went away. I was on meds at that time, but I think I think it's coming back now.\n\nD: OK, so you haven't been on medication now for for quite awhile for years.\n\nP: For like 12 years 13 years. \n\nD: OK, what did you use that, if you can remember?\n\nP: Prozac?\n\nD: OK, and did you find it helped?\n\nP: Yeah, yeah it was very helpful, was very good. \n\nD: OK. That's good. Any allergies to medications?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Alright and any hospitalizations or surgeries?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, and can you tell me a little bit about where you're living and who you're living with? \n\nP: I I live, I live with my girlfriend. \n\nD: OK.

Has there been anybody around that that has been sick that they have been around?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, have you traveled anywhere? \n\nP: No no.\n\nD: And do you smoke cigarettes?\n\nP: Oh no, I don't.\n\nD: OK, do you drink alcohol? \n\nP: I don't. \n\nD: OK. And. Are you currently sexually active?\n\nP: Yeah. \n\nD: OK, and any chance that you could be pregnant currently?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: And have you been pregnant in the past?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. And do you smoke cigarettes?\n\nP: I don't. \n\nD: Do you drink alcohol? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: And do you use any recreational drugs? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and any family history of heart or lung problems?\n\nP: My grandfather had lung cancer.

Anybody in in the family have problems with substance, substance use?\n\nP: no.\n\nD: OK. Um, and  I think that's everything that I I wanted to ask on history today. So you been having these episodes where you get really short of breath and you get chest pain, you'll get sweaty and have what sounds like what sounds like an impending sense of doom where you kind of feel like it's coming on and it lasts for 15 minutes and not related to exercise. Were there any other symptoms or things that you've been experiencing recently?\n\nP: Yeah, it's also,  I also feel like my heart's like breathing really fast.\n\nD: Oh, OK. And I does that, how long does it last for?\n\nP: Same time. Like everything is just sort of comes on at the same time. Just kind of goes away together.\n\nD: OK, would you say that it comes on like kind of like at the snap of your fingers sort of thing like really quickly and then?\n\nP: I can kind of tell it's gonna come on like I have a sense of it and then it just like starts. It suddenly just happens.\n\nD: OK. So you you have the heart racing, are there any other symptoms as well?\n\nP: I don't think so.\n\nD: OK, so, uh, we will get an ECG and  I will look at that, but I've been concerned now thinking that this might be related to anxiety or panic attacks and so, I guess that would be something that we could discuss more about in regards to like I guess previous traumas and things that and the stresses that you might be dealing with currently to help manage manage stress better.\n\nP: Sure, thank you.\n\n",

    "ref_norm": "how may i help you hi i just want to talk about these these times when i feel like i am just i am suffocating and i just can not breathe it is pretty scary and i do not know what is going on yeah certainly feeling short of breath like that can be quite scary for sure when when do these episodes kind of happen are they spontaneous or can you think of things that you are doing when they when they come on uhm i i do not know it is just like uhm sometimes like before interviews sometimes just kind of random uhm yeah i can kind of tell when they are about to come on uhm yeah i think it is mostly like job interviews ok have you had many of those recently job interviews yeah i got i got laid off because of the pandemic and now i have been looking for jobs and it is just like it is kind of nerve wracking but also like i do not know i am just worried it could be something else like it is just yeah it is like i really just can not breathe it is so weird ok yeah it is certainly it sounds like there has been a lot of stress recently certainly plenty for with the pandemic as well and so when you get short of breath you you said you have this you could feel that it is coming on and how long does it last for like 15 minutes 15 20 minutes is there anything you do to help it go away i will just say go and lie down and close my eyes ok and do you get shorter breath if you walk far distances or exert yourself 0 no no i go out for a run every single day nothing happens at that time ok and have you had a cough no any wheezing no ok and have you had any any chest pain yeah i kind of feel like this pressure at that time is just like yeah someone is like pressing my chest inwards kind of it is hard to explain i see do you it is it like do you feel it in any one particular spot or no ok i just feel like my chest is really tight and it is just it is like i can not like expand my lungs i see and does this last around 15 minutes as well yeah ok and similarly you like going for runs and stuff like that you 0 not ever get any chest pain no no no ok and and i know you mentioned you did not have a cough but have you brought up any phlegm or brought up any any blood no no i have not had a cough 0 no ok i am sorry that is ok and have you otherwise been well or if you had any infectious symptoms like a runny or red eyes runny nose or sore throat no none of those alright have you had any headaches no how about any fevers or chills no have you had any night sweats no but i get really sweaty when these episodes happen just like yeah my face is like sweating and my neck ok yeah ok and how is your weight been recently any weight gain or loss yeah i have gained quite a bit of weight since the pandemic started yeah gained about \u00a310 ok any changes to your diet or appetite 0 yeah i have been eating quite a bit been baking a lot at home ok and and have you had any abdominal pains no any diarrhea uhm no ok any nausea or vomiting no alright and any urinary problems like pain or frequency no any rashes or skin changes no and any muscle aches body pains or joint pains or swelling nothing like that no ok and how is your energy been well i have been feeling a little low since i have been laid off just like worried about my finances and i kind of sleep all day i am not feeling very energetic ok how is your interest in activities been i do not know i just feel like staying at home and just being in bed all the time ok so you are have you had a low mood yeah alright and are you sleeping more than usual yeah ok is there anything that you are feeling particularly guilty about right now no ok how is your concentration been uhm not great ok you have not been able to focus and have you felt like things are moving in slow motion no alright so have you had any thoughts of hurting or harming yourself no ok and have you had depression or anxiety in the past i have been diagnosed with depression ok and have you had panic attacks before no but do you think that is what is going on potentially it certainly can not rule out inorganic cause meaning something going on otherwise just yet we might need to do some physical exam and some investigations 1st but it certainly could be related to that with all of the stressors that are going on and so you had a low mood have you had any periods in your life where you felt really energetic like you did not need any sleep you are really talkative you had all the energy in the world i wish no i have never really felt that way ok and have you had any concerns with eating disorders in the past no alright and then you mentioned even diagnosed with depression if you had are you have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions no ok are you on any medications right now no i was doing pretty well i used to have these episodes of depression when i was younger as a teenager and they kind of went away i was on meds at that time but i think i think it is coming back now ok so you have not been on medication now for for quite awhile for years for like 12 years 13 years ok what did you use that if you can remember prozac ok and did you find it helped yeah yeah it was very helpful was very good ok that is good any allergies to medications no alright and any hospitalizations or surgeries no ok and can you tell me a little bit about where you are living and who you are living with i i live i live with my girlfriend ok and has there been anybody around that that has been sick that they have been around no ok have you traveled anywhere no no and do you smoke cigarettes 0 no i do not ok do you drink alcohol i do not ok and are you currently sexually active yeah ok and any chance that you could be pregnant currently no and have you been pregnant in the past no ok and do you smoke cigarettes i do not do you drink alcohol no and do you use any recreational drugs no ok and any family history of heart or lung problems my grandfather had lung cancer but that is about it did he smoke for a long time 0 yeah he was a big smoker ok and anybody in the family have problems with mental illness my mom has depression too ok anybody in in the family have problems with substance substance use no ok and i think that is everything that i i wanted to ask on history today so you been having these episodes where you get really short of breath and you get chest pain you will get sweaty and have what sounds like what sounds like an impending sense of doom where you kind of feel like it is coming on and it lasts for 15 minutes and not related to exercise were there any other symptoms or things that you have been experiencing recently yeah it is also i also feel like my heart is like breathing really fast 0 ok and i does that how long does it last for same time like everything is just sort of comes on at the same time just kind of goes away together ok would you say that it comes on like kind of like at the snap of your fingers sort of thing like really quickly and then i can kind of tell it is going to come on like i have a sense of it and then it just like starts it suddenly just happens ok so you you have the heart racing are there any other symptoms as well i do not think so ok so we will get an ecg and i will look at that but i have been concerned now thinking that this might be related to anxiety or panic attacks and so i guess that would be something that we could discuss more about in regards to like i guess previous traumas and things that and the stresses that you might be dealing with currently to help manage manage stress better sure thank you",
