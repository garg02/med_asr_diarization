Is it like a wet cough, a dry cough? How would you describe it?\n\nP: Yeah, I brought up a little bit of sputum. It's been clear, mostly clear and sometimes dry as well. The cough's been getting worse over the last couple of days as well and hasn't really stopped either, it's just kind of ongoing all day.\n\nD: OK, so it's it's pretty constant?\n\nP: Yeah, it's been constant.\n\nD: OK, and how much sputum would you say you're bringing up? \n\nP: I would say, uh, maybe like two teaspoons a day.

Or does it have any blood tinge content in it?\n\nP: No, I haven't noticed anything like that.\n\nD: OK, so it's mainly just white or clear.\n\nP: Yeah, it's mostly, yeah, like whiteish or clear. \n\nD: OK, uhm, and have you had anything like this happen before? \n\nP: No, I haven't.\n\nD: OK, and how would you describe the shortness of breath? Are you having trouble taking deep breaths or are you having trouble breathing when exerting yourself, like how would you describe it?\n\nP: Yeah, I have like, a chest tightness. I find when I exert myself it gets worse and after I cough, I have a little bit of trouble catching my breath as well.\n\nD: OK, When do you have the chest tightness, when did that start?\n\nP: Uh, yeah, that's started within the last two days as well, with the cough.\n\nD: OK, so is it just the tightness when you cough or is it there just throughout?\n\nP: Yeah if I take like a deep breath in, like, it just feels tight, like I can't get a deep breath.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any kind of, like swelling in your calves, or pain in your calves at all?\n\nP: No, I haven't had anything like that.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any surgeries recently or have you been immobilized for a long time or admitted to a hospital or anything like that?\n\nP: No, I haven't had anything like that, I've been healthy.\n\nD: OK, and have you had anything like a blood clot, either in your legs or traveling up to your lungs in the past before?\n\nP: No, I haven't had anything like that.\n\nD: OK, and have you been diagnosed with cancer or any other medical conditions?\n\nP: No, I haven't. \n\nD: OK uhm, so would you say the coughing and the shortness of breath is getting worse, or it's about the same?\n\nP: I'd say it's gotten a little bit worse over these last couple of days.\n\nD: OK, and is there anything that makes your symptoms better or worse?\n\nP: Yeah, if I exert myself it does make it a bit worse. It'll bring on the cough more, and shortness of breath.\n\nD: OK, and how about any positional changes? Like, does lying down help?

Alright, so it seems that your shortness of breath, is it, uh, mainly when you're breathing in or breathing out? Or are you having shallow breaths? How would you describe it?\n\nP: I would say it, yeah, I kind of go back to the chest tightness, it just feels like I'm not able to, like, breath in all the way and catch my breath after I exert myself or coughing. It's easy Uh, like if I rest I'm not short of breath.\n\nD: OK, do you have any other symptoms? like a runny nose, sore throat?

Yeah, those are all the questions I had today and it seems that definitely there are some concerning symptoms like the shortness of breath and the cough especially also the loss of smell that you're having. We definitely want to make sure that you don't have coronavirus, so we will do a test for you today. And what we recommend in the meantime is to self isolate, even in your home, wear a mask around your family, if you can, like, eat separately, don't go outside and be off of work until the test results come back and then even after that, you might need to follow instructions of public health and self isolate for 14 days. If not coronavirus, hopefully, then it can also be other things, like, other viruses can cause similar symptoms as well, but yeah. So, we'll just get that test done and then see where to go from there.\n\nP: OK, that sounds great. Thank you.\n\nD: You welcome. Take care, bye.",

    "ref_norm": "so what brings you here today yeah so i have had this cough ongoing now for the last 3 days and i found i have had a more difficult time breathing as well ok and so what came 1st did the cough come 1st yeah the cough started 1st ok and so it started 3 days ago yeah when did the shortness of breath start that started probably about 2 days ago ok and the cough can you describe it a little bit is it like a wet cough a dry cough how would you describe it yeah i brought up a little bit of sputum it has been clear mostly clear and sometimes dry as well the cough has been getting worse over the last couple of days as well and has not really stopped either it is just kind of ongoing all day ok so it is it is pretty constant yeah it has been constant ok and how much sputum would you say you are bringing up i would say maybe like 2 teaspoons a day it is only like a little bit in the tissues and i am not bringing up sputum every time ok and is your sputum at all yellow green or does it have any blood tinge content in it no i have not noticed anything like that ok so it is mainly just white or clear yeah it is mostly yeah like whiteish or clear ok uhm and have you had anything like this happen before no i have not ok and how would you describe the shortness of breath are you having trouble taking deep breaths or are you having trouble breathing when exerting yourself like how would you describe it yeah i have like a chest tightness i find when i exert myself it gets worse and after i cough i have a little bit of trouble catching my breath as well ok when do you have the chest tightness when did that start yeah that is started within the last 2 days as well with the cough ok so is it just the tightness when you cough or is it there just throughout yeah if i take like a deep breath in like it just feels tight like i can not get a deep breath ok and have you had any kind of like swelling in your calves or pain in your calves at all no i have not had anything like that ok and have you had any surgeries recently or have you been immobilized for a long time or admitted to a hospital or anything like that no i have not had anything like that i have been healthy ok and have you had anything like a blood clot either in your legs or traveling up to your lungs in the past before no i have not had anything like that ok and have you been diagnosed with cancer or any other medical conditions no i have not ok uhm so would you say the coughing and the shortness of breath is getting worse or it is about the same i would say it is gotten a little bit worse over these last couple of days ok and is there anything that makes your symptoms better or worse yeah if i exert myself it does make it a bit worse it will bring on the cough more and shortness of breath ok and how about any positional changes like does lying down help does resting help relieve some of that tightness cough and shortness of breath no nothing like that has helped ok and have you tried any kind of medications at all over the counter no i have not tried anything ok alright so it seems that your shortness of breath is it mainly when you are breathing in or breathing out or are you having shallow breaths how would you describe it i would say it yeah i kind of go back to the chest tightness it just feels like i am not able to like breath in all the way and catch my breath after i exert myself or coughing it is easy like if i rest i am not short of breath ok do you have any other symptoms like a runny nose sore throat anything like that uhm nothing like that ok and any headaches i have had a little bit of a headache over the last day usually i get headaches like this when i have not slept well ok and is it like a different type of headache and is it on one side of your head or both yeah i feel it on both kinda like right up into my forehead there ok and is it kind of like a pressure like pain is it pulsating pain how would you describe it i would say it is more of a pressure yeah ok have you tried any medications for it uhm yeah i took an advil this morning it is taken the edge off a little bit i will use that sometimes when i get headaches are you having any nausea or vomiting no i have not had anything like that ok and have you traveled outside of the country or outside of the province at all no i have not have you been in contact with anyone that has been sick recently i do not think so i work at the toyota factory and there have been a few people that have been sick who worked there but i do not think i have been in contact with them ok and are you having any fevers or chills at all i have felt pretty hot yeah i was sweaty last night i did not check a temperature but i felt feverish ok were you having night sweats my bed was not drenched or anything but i was sweating ok are you feeling like you have lost any sense of taste or smell at all uhm yeah i have not been able to smell very well ok and when did that start that may be within the last 2 days as well ok and are you congested at all like do you have a runny nose or anything like that no i do not have anything like that ok yeah any changes in your bowel movements like any constipation or diarrhea no i have not had anything like that ok any muscle aches yeah i have felt a bit sore where would you say you feel sore just kind of all over my whole body just kind of feels a bit achy ok and when did this start yeah probably like last night this morning when i was laying down and just felt a bit tired and achy ok has your sleep or appetite changed at all i did not sleep very good last night i just do not feel very rested this morning and yeah i have not felt very hungry either ok uhm alright do you have any medical conditions that you take any medications for no i do not take any medications ok and have you had any surgeries or have been hospitalized before i did have tubes in my ears when i was little but that is it though ok any family history of any
