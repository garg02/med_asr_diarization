I think it was 400 milligrams.\n\nD: OK and do you have any allergies?\n\nP: Um, yeah, to cats.\n\nD: Have you been around a cat recently?\n\nP: No, we used to have a cat, but unfortunately we were unable to keep it because allergies were so bad.\n\nD: Yeah, do you have any environmental allergies at all? \n\nP: Uhm, yeah sometimes in the spring or fall I can get like itchy eyes and a runny nose, so that's why I didn't think much about the runny nose at first, but with a sore throat and, been sneezing more, I thought to come in. \n\nD: Yeah, OK. So in terms of your, uh, so general information. Do you live alone or do you live with your parents or anyone else?\n\nP: Yeah, I live with my mom, dad and a younger brother.\n\nD: Alright, and are you currently working or going to school?\n\nP: Yeah, I'm finishing up Grade 8 and we're doing the courses online.\n\nD: OK, great so, have you spent any time outdoors or spent any time with people who you think might be sick?\n\nP: Well, I've played some, like, basketball outside with one of the neighbors, but I don't think he's been sick.\n\nD: OK, alright, and have you traveled anywhere recently?\n\nP: No, I've been at home.\n\nD: OK, uhm, alright, and do you, uhm, have you had these symptoms anytime recently before?\n\nP: No, not that I can think of.\n\nD: No, have you been tested for covid anytime in the recent past?\n\nP: No, I haven't.\n\nD: Have you taken any antibiotics recently?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, alright well it sounds like you're probably having just a common cold, likely viral.
