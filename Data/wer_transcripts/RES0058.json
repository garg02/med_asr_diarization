And how about any fatigue? Do you feel like you're more tired than usual? \n\nP: Yeah, these past few days I have definitely. I felt more tired, I've been sleeping a lot more throughout the day and just I don't know, kind of lazy. \n\nD: Yeah, and I know you mentioned you're having a hard time tasting. How about your appetite though? Do you feel like you've lost appetite?\n\nP: I think appetite's been OK.

I felt better. \n\nD: OK, good good. Do you think that this morning you were dizzy because you were dehydrated? Or is this like a normal thing for you?\n\nP: I mean, I guess I could have been dehydrated. I didn't even think of that, but I mean, since the food didn't taste so great, I don't know. I probably didn't eat as much yesterday or the last couple of days. Maybe I haven't eaten as much. \n\nD: OK, Yep. OK, do you feel weak?\n\nP: I don't know, maybe. Maybe a little weak, but umm, just way more tired.\n\nD: OK, any confusion or memory loss?\n\nP: Umm, no, I have been able to do some of my school work.\n\nD: OK, good. And you mentioned no rashes, right?\n\nP: No rash. \n\nD: OK, any weight loss over the past couple of months?\n\nP:: Nothing like that. No weight change, it's been the same.\n\nD: OK, how about umm night sweats or chills?\n\nP: I felt a bit, umm, hot but not sweaty, just hot.\n\nD: OK, so kind of like you have a fever?\n\nP: Yeah, I guess so, maybe.\n\nD: Sure any muscle aches? \n\nP: Umm, no muscle aches. \n\nD: Have you been around anyone who's been sick recently?\n\nP: Yeah there is this guy in my class who was sick in class last week.\n\nD: What kind of symptoms did he have?\n\nP: Well, he had a cough and fever. Yeah, I think he had a cough and a fever and somebody said that. Maybe a sore throat or something like that.\n\nD: OK, so yeah, some symptoms overlap with yours I guess. Have you traveled anywhere recently?\n\nP: Oh no, I've been at home. We just started back at going in person to school again.\n\nD: OK, that's good. And are you otherwise healthy?\n\nP: Yeah, I haven't been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past.\n\nD: Oh good, OK. And do you have any allergies?\n\nP: Possibly cats but we don't have any pets at home.\n\nD: OK, good have you been around cats recently?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK and then any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?\n\nP: I did have my appendix taken out like 4 four years ago. Yeah, at the beginning of high school, but that was the only surgeryand everything went well.\n\nD: OK, are you up to date with all your immunizations?\n\nP: I am, yeah. I have my immunization card here actually.\n\nD: OK, good. Any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions that you know of?\n\nP: I know my grandfather had lung cancer, but he smoked his whole life also. Also diabetes but don't know if he had any heart problems though. \n\nD: OK, I'm sorry I forgot to ask you, are you on any medications?\n\nP: Umm, I'm not.\n\nD: OK, and do you smoke?\n\nP: Umm, I don't.\n\nD: OK, how about marijuana?\n\nP: Uh, no. Oh, but I guess I use a vape every once in a while.. \n\nD: With like marijuana?\n\nP: No, it's like those flavored ones. \n\nD: Oh OK, yeah. How often do you use that?\n\nP: It's like a few times a day.\n\nD: OK, and is there any tobacco in there or nicotine?\n\nP: I think there might be, but umm, I don't know. I usually just buy the flavored ones.\n\nD: OK, well, you should probably look into if it has tobacco or nicotine, because neither of those are good for your health. And so we can, you know, have a discussion later on trying to cut down or quitting completely if you are open to that.\n\nP: Yeah, sure. \n\nD: I'll just continue on asking you some other questions. Do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: Umm, no.\n\nD: And who do you live with?\n\nP: I live with my mom, my step dad, and then my younger sister.\n\nD: OK, do you guys live in a house?\n\nP: We live in a townhouse.\n\nD: OK, in the city you said?\n\nP: Yeah, yeah, I live close. I go to high school not too far from here.\n\nD: Oh, that's nice. And any concerns with the living arrangements in terms of you know, like it being an old building, old carpets, mold, anything like that?\n\nP: No, I live in a nice place. It's usually like really clean.\n\nD: OK, good, umm alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns that you wanted to bring up?\n\nP: I guess the only thing that I was concerned about was possibly having COVID. \n\nD: Yeah, you know, that's probably top on my list of things to investigate you for, so I would say COVID or other viral illnesses that could be going around this time of year. That would have less of a similar presentation, and so we will do a COVID swab for you. And in the meantime, if you could isolate for 14 days, regardless of whether the swab comes back positive or negative, and that would be great. If the swab comes back positive, we will notify public health and they'll try to trace where you could have caught this from and if it turns out it's not a viral illness, we will try to work you up for any bacterial infections which can be treated with antibiotics. So that's where we will start, does that sound good?\n\nP: Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nD: OK great, well have a great day.\n\nP: Yeah, thank you.",

black 0 no it it was not dark like that ok good any abdominal pain no any issues swallowing food umm no issues swallowing food my throat has felt a bit itchy i mean i have been coughing alot does it feel sore as well not really or just kind of yeah kind of scratchy ok have you had a runny nose or a blocked nose umm not really no ok any rashes umm no i have not noticed any rashes ok and are things normal with your urine yeah they are how about dizziness or fainting spells umm a little bit dizzy i when i got out of bed this morning but we sat back down for a couple of minutes i felt better ok good good do you think that this morning you were dizzy because you were dehydrated or is this like a normal thing for you i mean i guess i could have been dehydrated i did not even think of that but i mean since the food did not taste so great i do not know i probably did not eat as much yesterday or the last couple of days maybe i have not eaten as much ok yep ok do you feel weak i do not know maybe maybe a little weak but umm just way more tired ok any confusion or memory loss umm no i have been able to do some of my school work ok good and you mentioned no rashes right no rash ok any weight loss over the past couple of months nothing like that no weight change it has been the same ok how about umm night sweats or chills i felt a bit umm hot but not sweaty just hot ok so kind of like you have a fever yeah i guess so maybe sure any muscle aches umm no muscle aches have you been around anyone who has been sick recently yeah there is this guy in my class who was sick in class last week what kind of symptoms did he have well he had a cough and fever yeah i think he had a cough and a fever and somebody said that maybe a sore throat or something like that ok so yeah some symptoms overlap with yours i guess have you traveled anywhere recently 0 no i have been at home we just started back at going in person to school again ok that is good and are you otherwise healthy yeah i have not been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past 0 good ok and do you have any allergies possibly cats but we do not have any pets at home ok good have you been around cats recently no ok and then any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past i did have my appendix taken out like 44 years ago yeah at the beginning of high school but that was the only surgeryand everything went well ok are you up to date with all your immunizations i am yeah i have my immunization card here actually ok good any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions that you know of i know my grandfather had lung cancer but he smoked his whole life also also diabetes but do not know if he had any heart problems though ok i am sorry i forgot to ask you are you on any medications umm i am not ok and do you smoke umm i do not ok how about marijuana no 0 but i guess i use a vape every once in a while . with like marijuana no it is like those flavored ones 0 ok yeah how often do you use that it is like a few times a day ok and is there any tobacco in there or nicotine i think there might be but umm i do not know i usually just buy the flavored ones ok well you should probably look into if it has tobacco or nicotine because neither of those are good for your health and so we can you know have a discussion later on trying to cut down or quitting completely if you are open to that yeah sure i will just continue on asking you some other questions do you drink alcohol umm no and who do you live with i live with my mom my step dad and then my younger sister ok do you guys live in a house we live in a townhouse ok in the city you said yeah yeah i live close i go to high school not too far from here 0 that is nice and any concerns with the living arrangements in terms of you know like it being an old building old carpets mold anything like that no i live in a nice place it is usually like really clean ok good umm alright so those are all the questions i had for you did you have any questions or any concerns that you wanted to bring up i guess the only thing that i was concerned about was possibly having covid yeah you know that is probably top on my list of things to investigate you for so i would say covid or other viral illnesses that could be going around this time of year that would have less of a similar presentation and so we will do a covid swab for you and in the meantime if you could isolate for 14 days regardless of whether the swab comes back positive or -and that would be great if the swab comes back positive we will notify public health and they will try to trace where you could have caught this from and if it turns out it is not a viral illness we will try to work you up for any bacterial infections which can be treated with antibiotics so that is where we will start does that sound good yeah that makes sense ok great well have a great day yeah thank you",
