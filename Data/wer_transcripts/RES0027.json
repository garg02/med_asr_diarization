complications with that surgery no alright so next i was wondering if you could just tell me a little bit about your living situation sure i live with my husband and 2 children who are both teenagers i we live in a in a townhouse and we moved recently ok and anybody in the home been sick my husband has been throwing up for the past 2 days and i think he was feeling a little hot too ok has he been assessed by a physician no i tried to bring him today but he refused i see ok has he been around anybody who has been sick that you are aware of like at work or anything he works at this it company there are not a lot of them and they all have their own cubicles so you know maybe in the lunch room or something but other than that i do not think so ok and how about yourself any other exposures or sick contacts or maybe at work or something like that so i do marketing stuff online but i i work from home ok and your kids have been well 0 yeah they have been they have been healthy alright and do you smoke cigarettes no and do you drink alcohol i will have a glass of wine with dinner once in awhile ok do you and what is once in awhile maybe every 3 or 4 days ok so a couple of drinks per week yeah alright and do you smoke marijuana i have smoked marijuana i do not regularly do it no ok and do you use any other recreational drugs no ok and has anybody in the family had a lung condition or or a heart condition before my sister who is 15 years older than i am she had a heart attack quite recently 0 i am sorry to hear that do you know what happened you know i am not too sure she does not always eat the healthiest and she does not do a lot of exercise so i think maybe that had something to do with it ok and did your parents have any heart problems no they were both healthy and they passed away a few years ago but they died of old age i guess you can say ok any cancers in the family no alright so i think that is all i wanted to cover on the history today was there anything that you wanted to tell me i maybe did not ask no i was just curious if you think i had covid certainly one of the top things that i am considering after hearing about your symptoms of having this cough and fever and being tired these last few days especially with your husband being sick with nausea vomiting and not feeling well that being said it could be another type of viral illness or possibly a bacterial infection but certainly we will order some investigations some blood work a pcr nasal swab that will actually test for covid as well as a chest x ray to start with and we will wait for some of those results to come back ok yeah that sounds good alright so we will get that started ok thank you",
