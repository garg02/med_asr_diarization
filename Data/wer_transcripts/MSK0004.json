Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?\n\nP: I'm uh, I had diarrhea a few months ago and I was given a fluoroquinolone as an antibiotic.\n\nD: OK, that's two months ago. OK. And any medications that you're on currently?\n\nP: I I take a Vitamin D and some other vitamins too. Vitamin A as well I guess that just helps my my skin and and then the vitamin D for my my bones.\n\nD: OK, any allergies to medications or any environmental issues?\n\nP: No allergies, no. \n\nD: OK, any hospitalizations or previous surgeries?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK. Any family history of any musculoskeletal conditions, any rheumatological conditions. Anything that you know of?\n\nP: My grandparents have arthritis, so and my like my dad had had gout before.\n\nD: OK, and do your grandparents have rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, do you know?\n\nP: I think osteo yeah osteoarthritis.\n\nD: OK, and do you currently work?\n\nP: I do, yeah, I work as a software engineer.\n\nD: OK, and what's your living situation like currently?\n\nP: Right now I'm actually just living alone in a in an apartment.\n\nD: Ok, and do you smoke at all?\n\nP: No, never I can't with the with all this like training for yeah at the race and stuff like that.\n\nD: OK, that's good. Any recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, anything like that before?\n\nP: No, I've never used anything like that in the past.\n\nD: OK, and how about alcohol?\n\nP: Uh rarely I'll have maybe a glass of wine like once every couple of months, but it's pretty infrequent.\n\nD: OK. Alright, so I just have a few questions. Right now over your right ankle, do you have, so you mentioned you don't have any swelling, but do you notice any kind of redness or warmth at all?\n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, and if you press down on your ankle, does it hurt a lot?\n\nP: Uh a little bit of pain now that right, uh, like outside, but it's not uh, it doesn't hurt that bad. Yeah, I'll say no.\n\nD: OK, and if you kind of, uh, are you able to move your ankle at all?\n\nP: I can, yeah I can move it around a little bit. I'm trying to avoid that though, just because it it does hurt, but I can move it around.\n\nD: OK. And are you able to stand up and walk or are you not able to do that right now?\n\nP: I can, yeah, just for short periods of time 'cause it's just 'cause of the pain, but I can walk on it.\n\nD: Ok, yeah, so definitely what we'll do is we might need to get like a proper physical examination done to make sure there is no fracture. Most likely though, it seems that this may just be an ankle sprain uh, due to you inverting your ankle the other day. Uhm, what we can do is usually we just immobilize the ankle and then recommend applying ice. You can take some NSAIDS like Advil for pain to help you. And it should it should get better on its own, with some physiotherapy later on as well. However, if we find that on physical examination you are having significant pain on palpation or any kind of bony pain, we might also require you to get an X Ray of the right foot and ankle, as well as just your lower leg. So yeah, we'll have you come come in in person and then go from there and see if you need an X Ray.\n\nP: OK, that sounds good, thank you.\n\nD: Alright, take care bye.\n",
