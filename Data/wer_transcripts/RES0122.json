Um, any uh, anything that makes the, that makes it worse? I know that lying on one side, you said, makes things worse for you. Anything else that's made the pressure worse?\n\nP: Um, no, I would say that's, that's about it.\n\nD: Okay, any changes in your sense of smell?\n\nP: Yeah, definitely. Uh when I get really stuff, stuffy, like I don't really smell anything.\n\nD: What about sense of taste?\n\nP: Um taste, I guess, like with the smell gone sometimes like the taste feels weird too, but like not, not really.\n\nD: I see, okay.

Alright, well that's all the questions I had for you given the symptoms that you've shared with me, it sounds like you might have something called um, rhinosinusitis, uh which is basically inflammation of the sinuses and of the uh, of the nasal cavity or the area inside your nose, and uh, often it's just treated with conservative management, so just continue to take um, Tylenol if that seems to help you, and do the steam therapy. It will take time to get better, um, but if you feel that it's um, it's not getting better in the next week or so, give us a call again and we can maybe see if it's a bacterial infection and see if um, if antibiotics might be needed but oftentimes it's usually a viral infection, and antibiotics are not needed, and sort of just resting and taking care of yourself, um, and trying to manage the symptoms that way can help. Um, but also check your temperature here to see if you have any fevers and uh, go from there. We'll also, I guess, we'll also do a COVID swab because your symptoms do overlap with some of those symptoms. Um, and we'd recommend that you quarantine until at least uh swabs, swab results are out and then public health will let you know what to do. \n\nP: Okay.\n\nD: Do you have any questions for me?\n\nP: Uh no, that's all.
