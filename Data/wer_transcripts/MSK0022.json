    "ref": "D: What brings you here today?\n\nP: I have been having this, pains in my in my joints that's been ongoing now for the last several months and it's been getting worse over this period of time.\n\nD: OK, so several months, is the pain, so where, where exactly is the pain?\n\nP: So I get it in some of the joints in my hands. And then also my feet as well. So yeah my. Yeah, really in my feet and my hands.\n\nD: OK, and what kind of pain is it, is it like an aching pain, is it sharp pain?\n\nP: It'll be a bit at achey when it's there, but I if I move the joints at all when it's really sore, I can get a sharp pain as well.\n\nD: OK, and is this pain worse at all at any particular time of the day?\n\nP: Yeah, I would say in the morning time or if there's any period of time where I I'm like sitting and resting for awhile and I get up to move. I have a lot of stiffness and it takes me over an hour, sometimes to just get moving.\n\nD: OK, um so so if I understand it clearly it's. You get, do you get like morning you get morning stiffness and then when you're not very active or not doing things but then it gets better with movement?\n\nP: Yeah, exactly, yeah there's morning stiffness and it does get a little bit better with with movement.\n\nD: OK, do you have any of this pain or stiffness in the bigger joints in your body, like the hips or the knees or your shoulders?\n\nP: Uh, no nothing, no. Just really the small joints.\n\nD: OK in the morning stiffness lasts more than 30 minutes you said?\n\nP: It does, yeah.\n\nD: Yes, OK. Is is it symmetrical like is the pain symmetrical as in is it happening in both hands in the same areas and both feet in the same areas?\n\nP: Yeah it is actually now that you mentioned that, it is symmetrical. I'm noticing that it's the same. It's the same joints on both sides of my body that I'm seeing that are affected.\n\nD: OK now yeah, I I just have. Yeah, this one particular question. It's pretty specific, so when you look at your hands in which joints are painful. In your fingers is, do you, do you have any pain or swelling in the last joints like so just um, just, below the tip of your fingers?\n\nP: No, actually like the those joints are all, have been fine. I can move the tips of my fingers no problem, and I haven't had any joint swelling or pain in the tips of my fingers.\n\nD: OK, and how about, have you had any pain at all in the, I guess the first joints of the finger. So when you make a fist like the first joint that bends?\n\nP: Oh yeah, like my knuckles, you mean?\n\nD: Yeah that your knuckles.\n\nP: Yeah, yeah those actually. Those are the worst I can notice, those kind of on the like on my index finger, middle finger and and ring finger on both sides they they all look like they're swollen and and those hurt hurt really bad.\n\nD: OK, and in your feet, which joints would you say are hurting the most?\n\nP: I, I would say the like the big toe joint. On both of my feet, those bother me. Yeah, but my big my big toe on on both feet, but my right foot's worse than the other.\n\nD: OK, I see OK. And are you getting any pain in any other joints?\n\nP: Um actually yeah my my right ankle bugs me a little bit. I'm sorry if that's considered a large joint. But yeah, my ankle hurts and then also my in my hands I have. Like the middle one. Not proximal interphalangeal joint, yeah those ones hurt too.\n\nD: OK. \n\nP: I think I have like more than 10 joints that are swollen and painful. \n\nD: OK, I see and has this pain been pretty constant or have there been days that you don't have the pain?\n\nP: Yeah, there are days that are better than others for sure. It just. I'm not really too sure what the reason it is like. Maybe I'm just more rested or something like that, but. There are days that that are better, but over the last several months it's been getting getting worse.\n\nD: OK, and how much would you rate the pain from zero to 10, 10 being the worst pain you felt in your life?\n\nP: I would say it's probably a 6.\n\nD: OK, have you tried any medications at all to help with your, help relieve your symptoms?\n\nP: Yeah, I've been trying. Um acetaminophen and different types of anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen or Advil and I've tried creams and stuff too but it it doesn't seem to, help.\n\nD: OK. Are you feeling any other symptoms at all, like fevers or chills?\n\nP: Um I do. I have felt a bit warm.\n\nD: A bit warm, OK and how long has that been going on for?\n\nP: So it that varies as well, like some days I'll get. I'll feel like feverish for a little bit and it will kind of go away. I haven't checked my temperature, but, it I have felt warm at times.\n\nD: OK, and have you lost any movement in any of these joints at all?\n\nP: Uh it is harder to to make a fist. Yeah I can't fully close my my fingers all the way down to make a fist.\n\nD: I see. OK. Any kind of a um night sweats at all? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any weight loss?\n\nP: Um, well I think a few pounds, I just haven't really been as as hungry now. Yeah, my appetite hasn't been been as good recently.\n\nD: OK, any skin changes or rashes?\n\nP: I over a couple of the joints, I do notice some some redness, but just over the the joints on my hand I can have some redness.\n\nD: OK, but you don't notice any changes anywhere else?\n\nP: No nowhere else.\n\nD: OK, any changes in your vision or hearing?\n\nP: No changes to vision or hearing.\n\nD: OK. Any shortness of breath, chest pain?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Any changes in your bowel movements?\n\nP: No, that's been normal.\n\nD: OK, any changes in your urinary patterns?\n\nP: Nope, I haven't had any pain or anything like that. \n\nD: OK, any numbness or tingling sensation anywhere, anywhere in your body?\n\nP: Nope, I haven't had anything like that.\n\nD: OK, have you been sick at all recently, either with like cold symptoms of any viral symptoms?\n\nP: No, I felt OK.\n\nD: OK and any muscle weakness? \n\nP: I. I don't think so. I've just I I have had trouble like opening jars and various things, but I think that's part of the, um like pain that I'm having in my in my hands it makes it hard to grip. \n\nD: OK, uhm. And in terms of your medical history, have you been diagnosed with any conditions?\n\nP: Uh, yeah I have a low thyroid and or or hypothyroidism. I think it's called I and I also have. Uh, high blood pressure, so I take my medication for high blood pressure and and something for the thyroid as well.\n\nD: OK, and when were you diagnosed with the hypothyroidism?\n\nP: Um this was about I like four years ago.\n\nD: OK, today tell you what it was caused by it at all. \n\nP: Oh, I think I was, I think they said Hashimoto's.\n\nD: OK, OK, OK, and since then you've been on the thyroid medication?\n\nP: Yeah, I think it's like Synthroid or or something like that. Yeah I think Synthroid.\n\nD: Alright. Any other medications at all that you take regularly?\n\nP: Yeah, I think it, I'm taking an ACE inhibitor for the blood pressure.\n\nD: OK, any allergies to any medications that you know?\n\nP: Uh, no. \n\nD: OK, any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK. Any family history of any autoimmune conditions? \n\nP: My mom had hypothyroidism as well, and uh, and that's it. \n\nD: OK, so anything else like rheumatoid arthritis, ulcertaive colitis, Crohn's disease, type one, diabetes, anything like that?\n\nP: I I think my cousin actually has type one diabetes. He's a, like he's much younger than me, but yeah, I think he I have a cousin with type one diabetes as well. \n\nD: OK. Alright, and um currently do you work?\n\nP: Yeah, I've been working as a administrator so it's been tough on the computer with with how my hands have been causing me pain.\n\nD: Oh so from the typing also gives you some pain?\n\nP: Yeah I can. It can give me a little bit of pain, but once my hands start moving it's it's OK. It's just I'm a bit slower at my job with with how it is, especially starting in the morning.\n\nD: OK, I see. OK, and currently what's your living situation like?\n\nP: So I live with my husband as well as our, uh, our daughter. She's 4.\n\nD: OK, and are you currently right now, do you smoke at all?\n\nP: I I don't. I quit smoking four years ago when my daughter was born and before that I didn't smoke much to me anyway it was I was only smoking like you like maybe four or five cigarettes a day so I just stopped then.\n\nD: OK, that's really good. Uh, uh, congratulations.\n\nP: Thank you.\n\nD: Yeah, and other than that, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?\n\nD: Uh, no, I don't. OK, how about alcohol?\n\nP: I'll have a glass of wine sometimes, but very rarely.\n\nD: OK. Um yeah, so those are just some of the questions I had for you now. I just wanted to ask a few questions regarding just physically examining the joints that hurt. So when you look at those joints, do you notice any kind of swelling, redness, or when you feel any warmth to them?\n\nP: Yes I yeah I do. I feel swelling, warmth and redness.\n\nD: OK, and do you notice any kind of deformities, for example like you're not able to bend your finger or any kind of deformities that you didn't see before? Or, like, for example, your wrist is turned uh, outwards a little bit. Anything like that?\n\nP: Uh, no, nothing like that, no deformity.\n\nD: No deformities. OK, when you go over your joints, do you notice any kind of like nodules or harder materials that don't seem to be your bones?\n\nP: Not really, no. No, I don't notice anything like that. They just share a bit larger from the swelling it feels like.\n\nD: OK, I see. Are you able to make a fist with both both hands?\n\nP: Not completely, I can close my hands part of the way, but I can't make a full fist.\n\nD: I see. OK and are you able to completely extend your fingers and show your palms?\n\nP: Yeah I can do. I can do that.\n\nD: OK. And are you able to walk without a limp or anything like that?\n\nP: Um, yes I can. \n\nD: OK. Alright, so those are just all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?\n\nP: Um no, I'm just wondering what what this could be.\n\nD: Yeah, so from what you're describing to me you do fit into. The age range and all the symptoms are kind of point towards arthritis, and in this case it sounds more like rheumatoid arthritis. Ddefinitely it can be different types of arthritis that we will investigate just in case as well. But given that it's symmetrical, you have the morning stiffness that doesn't go away for more than 30 minutes and just the pattern of where those where the stiffness and pain is occurring itt sounds more likely to be rheumatoid arthritis, especially since you've also, you also have another autoimmune condition with hypothyroidism, it's more likely to be another autoimmune condition. So what we will do is get a few tests done. This will involve some blood work as well. And we will also get some imaging done, so we will get like the CRP and ESR for inflammatory markers we will get like your full CBC blood count we will get rheumatoid factor test done as well as antinuclear antibody and a lot of other different just markers to rule out anything else besides rheumatoid arthritis and then we will also get just X-Rays of your hands and feet as well. So does that sound good?\n\nP: It does, yeah, thank you.\n\nD: You're welcome. And then if it does come out to be rheumatoid arthritis arthritis, which seems likely, you will need a referral to a rheumatologist to manage and treat your, uh, treat you with medications.\n\nD: OK, thank you alright, you're welcome. Take care. \n",

tests done this will involve some blood work as well and we will also get some imaging done we will get a crp and esr for inflammatory markers a full cbc blood count a rheumatoid factor test as well as anti nuclear antibody and a lot of other different markers to rule out anything else besides rheumatoid arthritis and then we will also get x rays of your hands and feet as well does that sound good it does yeah thank you you are welcome and then if it does come out to be rheumatoid arthritis which seems likely you will need a referral to a rheumatologist to manage and treat you with medications ok thank you you are welcome take care",
    "pred_norm_d": "what brings you in here today ok so several months is the pain so where exactly is the pain ok and what kind of pain is it is it like an aching pain is it a sharp pain ok and is this pain worse at all at any particular time of the day ok so if i understand it clearly you get morning stiffness and then when you are not very active or not doing things but then it gets better with movement ok and do you have any of this pain or stiffness in the bigger joints in your body like the hips or the knees or your shoulders ok and the morning stiffness lasts more than 30 minutes you said ok and is it symmetrical like is the pain symmetrical as in is it happening in both hands in the same areas and both feet in the same areas ok now i just have one particular question it is pretty specific so when you look at your hands and which joints are painful in your fingers do you have any pain or swelling in the last joints like just below the tip of your fingers ok and how about the 1st joints of the finger so when you make a fist like the 1st joint that bends yeah your knuckles ok and in your feet which joints would you say are hurting the most ok i see and are you getting any pain in any other joints interphalangeal joint ok i see and has this pain been pretty constant or have there been days that you do not have the pain ok and how much would you rate the pain from 0 to 10 10 being the worst pain you have felt in your life ok have you tried any medications at all to help relieve your symptoms ok are you feeling any other symptoms at all like fevers or chills a bit warm ok and how long has that been going on for ok and have you lost any movement in any of these joints at all i see any night sweats at all any weight loss ok any skin changes or rashes ok but you do not notice any changes anywhere else ok any changes in your vision or hearing ok any shortness of breath chest pain ok any changes in your bowel movements ok any changes in your urinary patterns ok any numbness or tingling sensation anywhere in your body ok have you been sick at all recently either with cold symptoms or any viral symptoms ok and any muscle weakness ok and in terms of your medical history have you been diagnosed with any conditions ok and when were you diagnosed with the hypothyroidism ok and did they tell you what it was caused by at all ok and since then you have been on the thyroid medication all right any other medications at all that you take regularly ok any allergies to any medications that you know of ok any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past ok any family history of any autoimmune conditions ok so anything else like rheumatoid arthritis ulcerative colitis crohn is disease type one diabetes anything like that ok all right and currently do you work 0 so typing also gives you some pain ok i see and currently what is your living situation like ok and do you smoke at all ok that is really good congratulations and other than that do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana ok how about alcohol ok so those were just some of the questions i had for you now i just wanted to ask a few questions regarding physically examining the joints that hurt so when you look at those joints do you notice any kind of swelling redness or warmth to them ok and do you notice any kind of deformities for example like you are not able to bend your finger or any kind of deformities that you did not see before or like for example your wrist is turned outwards a little bit anything like that ok when you go over your joints do you notice any kind of nodules or harder materials that do not seem to be your bones ok i see and are you able to make a fist with both hands i see and are you able to completely extend your fingers and show your palms ok and are you able to walk without a limp or anything like that ok so those are just all the questions i had for you today do you have any questions or concerns yeah so from what you are describing to me you do fit into the age range and all the symptoms kind of point towards arthritis in this case it sounds more like rheumatoid arthritis definitely it can be different types of arthritis that we will investigate as well but given that it is symmetrical you have the morning stiffness that does not go away for more than 30 minutes and just the pattern of where the stiffness and pain is occurring it sounds more likely to be rheumatoid arthritis especially since you also have another autoimmune condition with hypothyroidism it is more likely to be another autoimmune condition so what we will do is get a few tests done this will involve some blood work as well and we will also get some imaging done we will get a crp and esr for inflammatory markers a full cbc blood count a rheumatoid factor test as well as anti nuclear antibody and a lot of other different markers to rule out anything else besides rheumatoid arthritis and then we will also get x rays of your hands and feet as well does that sound good you are welcome and then if it does come out to be rheumatoid arthritis which seems likely you will need a referral to a rheumatologist to manage and treat you with medications you are welcome take care",

    "ref_norm": "what brings you here today i have been having this pains in my in my joints that has been ongoing now for the last several months and it has been getting worse over this period of time ok so several months is the pain so where where exactly is the pain so i get it in some of the joints in my hands and then also my feet as well so yeah my yeah really in my feet and my hands ok and what kind of pain is it is it like an aching pain is it sharp pain it will be a bit at achey when it is there but i if i move the joints at all when it is really sore i can get a sharp pain as well ok and is this pain worse at all at any particular time of the day yeah i would say in the morning time or if there is any period of time where i i am like sitting and resting for awhile and i get up to move i have a lot of stiffness and it takes me over an hour sometimes to just get moving ok so so if i understand it clearly it is you get do you get like morning you get morning stiffness and then when you are not very active or not doing things but then it gets better with movement yeah exactly yeah there is morning stiffness and it does get a little bit better with with movement ok do you have any of this pain or stiffness in the bigger joints in your body like the hips or the knees or your shoulders no nothing no just really the small joints ok in the morning stiffness lasts more than 30 minutes you said it does yeah yes ok is is it symmetrical like is the pain symmetrical as in is it happening in both hands in the same areas and both feet in the same areas yeah it is actually now that you mentioned that it is symmetrical i am noticing that it is the same it is the same joints on both sides of my body that i am seeing that are affected ok now yeah i i just have yeah this one particular question it is pretty specific so when you look at your hands in which joints are painful in your fingers is do you do you have any pain or swelling in the last joints like so just just below the tip of your fingers no actually like the those joints are all have been fine i can move the tips of my fingers no problem and i have not had any joint swelling or pain in the tips of my fingers ok and how about have you had any pain at all in the i guess the 1st joints of the finger so when you make a fist like the 1st joint that bends 0 yeah like my knuckles you mean yeah that your knuckles yeah yeah those actually those are the worst i can notice those kind of on the like on my index finger middle finger and and ring finger on both sides they they all look like they are swollen and and those hurt hurt really bad ok and in your feet which joints would you say are hurting the most i i would say the like the big toe joint on both of my feet those bother me yeah but my big my big toe on on both feet but my right foot is worse than the other ok i see ok and are you getting any pain in any other joints actually yeah my my right ankle bugs me a little bit i am sorry if that is considered a large joint but yeah my ankle hurts and then also my in my hands i have like the middle one not proximal interphalangeal joint yeah those ones hurt too ok i think i have like more than 10 joints that are swollen and painful ok i see and has this pain been pretty constant or have there been days that you do not have the pain yeah there are days that are better than others for sure it just i am not really too sure what the reason it is like maybe i am just more rested or something like that but there are days that that are better but over the last several months it has been getting getting worse ok and how much would you rate the pain from 0 to 10 10 being the worst pain you felt in your life i would say it is probably a 6 ok have you tried any medications at all to help with your help relieve your symptoms yeah i have been trying acetaminophen and different types of anti inflammatories like ibuprofen or advil and i have tried creams and stuff too but it it does not seem to help ok are you feeling any other symptoms at all like fevers or chills i do i have felt a bit warm a bit warm ok and how long has that been going on for so it that varies as well like some days i will get i will feel like feverish for a little bit and it will kind of go away i have not checked my temperature but it i have felt warm at times ok and have you lost any movement in any of these joints at all it is harder to to make a fist yeah i can not fully close my my fingers all the way down to make a fist i see ok any kind of a night sweats at all no any weight loss well i think a few pounds i just have not really been as as hungry now yeah my appetite has not been been as good recently ok any skin changes or rashes i over a couple of the joints i do notice some some redness but just over the the joints on my hand i can have some redness ok but you do not notice any changes anywhere else no nowhere else ok any changes in your vision or hearing no changes to vision or hearing ok any shortness of breath chest pain no any changes in your bowel movements no that has been normal ok any changes in your urinary patterns nope i have not had any pain or anything like that ok any numbness or tingling sensation anywhere anywhere in your body nope i have not had anything like that ok have you been sick at all recently either with like cold symptoms of any viral symptoms no i felt ok ok and any muscle weakness i i do not think so i have just i i have had trouble like opening jars and various things but i think that is part of the like pain that i am having in my in my hands it makes it hard to grip ok uhm and in terms of your medical history have you been diagnosed with any conditions yeah i have a low thyroid and or or hypothyroidism i think it is called i and i also have high blood pressure so i take my medication for high blood pressure and and something for the thyroid as well ok and when were you diagnosed with the hypothyroidism this was about i like 4 years ago ok today tell you what it was caused by it at all 0 i think i was i think they said hashimoto is ok ok ok and since then you have been on the thyroid medication yeah i think it is like synthroid or or something like that yeah i think synthroid alright any other medications at all that you take regularly yeah i think it i am taking an ace inhibitor for the blood pressure ok any allergies to any medications that you know no ok any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past no ok any family history of any autoimmune conditions my mom had hypothyroidism as well and and that is it ok so anything else like rheumatoid arthritis ulcertaive colitis crohn is disease type one diabetes anything like that i i think my cousin actually has type one diabetes he is a like he is much younger than me but yeah i think he i have a cousin with type one diabetes as well ok alright and currently do you work yeah i have been working as a administrator so it has been tough on the computer with with how my hands have been causing me pain 0 so from the typing also gives you some pain yeah i can it can give me a little bit of pain but once my hands start moving it is it is ok it is just i am a bit slower at my job with with how it is especially starting in the morning ok i see ok and currently what is your living situation like so i live with my husband as well as our our daughter she is 4 ok and are you currently right now do you smoke at all i i do not i quit smoking 4 years ago when my daughter was born and before that i did not smoke much to me anyway it was i was only smoking like you like maybe 4 or 5 cigarettes a day so i just stopped then ok that is really good congratulations thank you yeah and other than that do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana no i do not ok how about alcohol i will have a glass of wine sometimes but very rarely ok yeah so those are just some of the questions i had for you now i just wanted to ask a few questions regarding just physically examining the joints that hurt so when you look at those joints do you notice any kind of swelling redness or when you feel any warmth to them yes i yeah i do i feel swelling warmth and redness ok and do you notice any kind of deformities for example like you are not able to bend your finger or any kind of deformities that you did not see before or like for example your wrist is turned outwards a little bit anything like that no nothing like that no deformity no deformities ok when you go over your joints do you notice any kind of like nodules or harder materials that do not seem to be your bones not really no no i do not notice anything like that they just share a bit larger from the swelling it feels like ok i see are you able to make a fist with both both hands not completely i can close my hands part of the way but i can not make a full fist i see ok and are you able to completely extend your fingers and show your palms yeah i can do i can do that ok and are you able to walk without a limp or anything like that yes i can ok alright so those are just all the questions i had for you today do you have any questions or concerns no i am just wondering what what this could be yeah so from what you are describing to me you do fit into the age range and all the symptoms are kind of point towards arthritis and in this case it sounds more like rheumatoid arthritis ddefinitely it can be different types of arthritis that we will investigate just in case as well but given that it is symmetrical you have the morning stiffness that does not go away for more than 30 minutes and just the pattern of where those where the stiffness and pain is occurring itt sounds more likely to be rheumatoid arthritis especially since you have also you also have another autoimmune condition with hypothyroidism it is more likely to be another autoimmune condition so what we will do is get a few tests done this will involve some blood work as well and we will also get some imaging done so we will get like the crp and esr for inflammatory markers we will get like your full cbc blood count we will get rheumatoid factor test done as well as antinuclear antibody and a lot of other different just markers to rule out anything else besides rheumatoid arthritis and then we will also get just x rays of your hands and feet as well so does that sound good it does yeah thank you you are welcome and then if it does come out to be rheumatoid arthritis arthritis which seems likely you will need a referral to a rheumatologist to manage and treat your treat you with medications ok thank you alright you are welcome take care",
