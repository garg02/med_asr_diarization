It's pretty red in the back of his throat when I was able to look, but yeah.\n\nD: OK, and has he ever experienced any of these symptoms before?\n\nP: Um, he's had sore throats before, but I think this one is a bit more severe. He hasn't complained this bad before. \n\nD: OK, OK. Um has he tried anything for it? Have you given him any over the counter medications?\n\nP: Yeah, we we did use some Tylenol and it brought the fever down so that was part of the reason why we we didn't come in 'cause he's had sore throats before but the fever bounced back and and the pain seems to have continued so we came in. \n\nD: Ok, OK. And is he otherwise healthy? Does he have any medical conditions?\n\nP: Uh, yeah, he's otherwise healthy no medical conditions, um hasn't been, had a reason to see a doctor before. \n\nD: No, OK. And then just how was pregnancy with him? Was it normal? Any complications?\n\nP: Um yeah there, so had um gestational diabetes, but it was treated, it was treated with diet. Um and blood sugars have been fine now, but no complications to the pregnancy from that regard as far as I know.\n\nD: OK, any alcohol or recreational drugs used during the pregnancy?\n\nP: No, nothing like that. No. No smoking either. \n\nD: OK, OK, good um and how far along were you when when you delivered him?\n\nP: Um it was a vaginal delivery just after 38 weeks.

Yeah, I think he was like just over 3 kilograms.\n\nD: OK, good and was he healthy after birth? Did he have any breathing issues? Jaundice? Anything like that? \n\nP: Um, no breathing issues or or jaundice. He came home with us right away.\n\nD: OK, OK and then after that point to now has he been normal in terms of his weight, height, head circumference? \n\nP: Yeah yeah. He's been growing normally and eating well up up to this point. \n\nD: OK, and I should ask um has he been hitting all his milestones like, is he doing the things that his peers are doing?\n\nP: Yeah, I would say he's keeping up with his his peers in daycare and no concerns with his development. \n\nD: OK, good. Is he on any medications? \n\nP: No medications.\n\nD: No. OK, and is he up to date with all his immunizations?\n\nP: He is yes. \n\nD: OK, and any allergies?\n\nP: Not that we're aware of.\n\nD: OK, any family history of lung conditions?\n\nP: Um no, no family history of any lung conditions. \n\nD: OK. And So who does, who does he live with at home?\n\nP: So he lives with my myself, and his father and then sister. So there's just the four of us at home.\n\nD: OK, and what's the relationship like between all of you? Any domestic issues? Or are things OK?\n\nP: Oh, things are are great at home. It's a really supportive environment. \n\nD: OK, good and does anyone smoke at home?\n\nP: No one smokes at home. \n\nD: No, OK. Um, any carpets at home? Old carpets?\n\nP: I think there's there's a few area rugs around, but most of the carpets are gone. \n\nD: OK, OK Um alright, so it sounds like, um grom what you're telling me, he ohh sorry, I should have asked you this earlier. Has he had any issues breathing?\n\nP: Um no problems breathing, but his voice does sound a bit, a little bit off. A bit Husky. \n\nD: A bit Husky, OK. Um alright and nothing like a seizure like a febrile seizure, right?\n\nP: No, I haven't seen any like limb jerking or anything like that.\n\nD: OK, so um, just roughly doing from the sounds of it, it sounds like he has a sore throat that's been persistent and we do this thing called the Centor score. So it sounds like he's had a fever, no cough, a sore throat. So the first thing that we want to check to see or to rule out would be a strep throat and then well if that comes back negative we will go from there and think about other viral causes versus strep throat as well. \n\nD: Did you have any questions or anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today?\n\nP: Um, no. We were thinking that it could be, uh, maybe strep throat. So um, yeah, thank you.\n\nD: OK, great, thank you.\n",
