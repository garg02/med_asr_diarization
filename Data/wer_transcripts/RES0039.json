Um, any previous hospitalizations?\n\nP: No, I've never been in the hospital before.\n\nD: OK, any previous surgery? So you said you had the appendix removed but anything else?\n\nP: Uh, no the appendix was the only thing. \n\nD: OK. Any family history of asthma or any lung conditions? Any cancers that run in the family?\n\nP: Um, yeah but well, my grandfather had lung cancer, but he smoked for his entire life. And my mom has had diabetes for quite some time, but no, no lung problems.\n\nD: OK, any heart attacks in the family or any autoimmune conditions?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, and currently what is your living situation like?\n\nP: So I live with uh, four roommates here going to school.\n\nD: OK, and so do you work right now or you just a student right now? \n\nP: Just a student.\n\nD: OK. And currently do you smoke?\n\nP: Uhm, I'mm smoke maybe maybe socially so, maybe a pack of cigarettes a week at the at the most.\n\nD: OK. And any recreational drug use like marijuana?\n\nP: Uh, yeah I'll smoke one or two joints on on the weekend with friends socially.\n\nD: OK yeah, so yeah. This uh, the smoking marijuana or cigarettes make your symptoms worse at all?\n\nP: Uhm, it depends. Yeah, sometimes I can. It can bring on some more coughing.\n\nD: Yeah, so yeah, we always recommend cutting down or quitting smoking whenever, whenever we see patients who are smoking, especially like, you're fairly young. And you know your grandfather had history of lung cancer with smoking throughout the year. So as early as we can quit smoking, the better for the long term health of your lungs, but whenever you're thinking of quitting, or if you want any more resources about quitting, just let me know. We can set up a separate appointment for that.\n\nP: OK, that that sounds good. Yeah, maybe maybe next appointment we can talk about that.\n\nD: OK, sounds good. Um. Any, uh, so no recreational, so just besides marijuana. Any other recreational drugs like cocaine or crystal meth, anything of that sort?\n\nP: Ah, no. Well, sometimes I at parties maybe a few times a year with friends will use ecstasy or something like that, but that's only a few times a year.\n\nD: OK. Uh, and any alcohol?\n\nP: Yeah, I'll have a few drinks on the weekend with with friends usually. Like rum or beer.\n\nD: OK. Yeah, so this is all the questions I had for you today. Any, any questions or concerns or any ideas of what you think this might be?\n\nP: Uhm, I don't know. I'm really concerned about the the blood that I brought up like I mean is this cancer or, uh, uh tuberculosis like one of those tuberculosis infections that I heard about while I was away?\n\nD: Yeah, so definitely, a cancer is pretty unlikely because you're fairly young and you've just recently started smoking, but one of the things that we're concerned about is your recent travel history being in close quarters. So definitely we need to get a chest X-Ray and we can even do a sputum culture to test for tuberculosis. And then based on the results, we might have to start you on like a whole antibiotic regiment if it does come back as tuberculosis. Yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll get those investigations done first and then we'll go from there.\n\nP: OK, thank you.\n\nD: We'll also get some blood work done as well, so that'll be done before your next appointment.\n\nP: Alright, that sounds good. Thank you. \n\nD: You're welcome.\n\n",

    "ref_norm": "i just wanted to start with what brings you here today to the family clinic hi this morning i read after i woke up by i coughed up some phlegm and there was some blood in it and it it

leading up to this ok and how long have you had the cough for uhm i have had it for uhm yeah about about 4 weeks wow 4 weeks ok do you know if you did anything prior to that any new exposures or being around someone ill like anything like that that might have caused your cough yeah i was just down in a i went to haiti on a on a trip for a for a volunteer program with my school and i do not know i definitely notice there is a lot of people down there coughing ok and were you at all living like close quarters or were you crammed into like like smaller spaces at all when you were there yeah we were kind of like living with the locals while we while we were there it was part of the experience for volunteering i was there for almost 2 months as part of part of my my summer break through university ok and did you notice at all any potential exposures to tuberculosis anyone there that had tuberculosis or found out later yeah there were definitely some people around that i heard of who who mentioned tuberculosis but i do not know if anybody specifically who had it ok and the cough that you have been having for the last 4 weeks at is it like a wet cough are you producing any sputum or phlegm or is it more of a dry cough i have been producing some phlegm but it has been just kind of white yellowish up until this morning yeah or moreso clear actually up until today where i saw some blood ok and how much blood was in the phlegm was it like a significant amount it filled the whole production or just little streaks it was pretty red it ah yeah it was bright red and it was covering the the issue ok and have you had any similar episodes before i have never brought up blood before and after this morning was that the only time you had that or did you did it recur at all it was just that time just this morning on the tissue and then a little bit in the toilet and it looked like a lot in the in the water ok i see and how often are you coughing in like an average day are you coughing throughout the day or does it come and go uhm it has been pretty severe through throughout the day i have been just coughing or coughing a ton ok anything that makes your coughing go away or makes it worse at all not nothing seems to help i have tried various over the counter medications and and stuff for for cough and nothing has seemed to help it ok and are you having any other symptoms at all like shortness of breath sore throat runny nose anything like that uhm nothing like like that i mean the back of my throat might feel a little itchy from the coughing but not really sure ok are you having any headaches or nausea or vomiting nothing like well a little bit of nausea maybe but no vomiting ok how often you getting nausea it is coming after like if i am having a really big cough coughing fit i could feel a little nauseous after but it does not last very long ok are you having any fevers or chills yeah i have been having ah so fevers throughout the day but feeling really hot and and really sweaty at night ok how often are you getting night sweats uhm also a few times this past week i have what woke up soaked ok and have you at all measured when you felt measured your temperature when you felt like these chills and night sweats no i have not measured my temperature yet ok have you noticed at all any increased fatigue throughout the day yeah but i have definitely been more more tired i have not been able to concentrate on umm on my schoolwork ok and have you been having any shortness of breath just after the like coughing really but otherwise ah no any chest pain no chest pain any feeling that your heart is racing no nothing like that ok any swelling in your limbs at all no ok any loss of sense of taste or smell no nothing like that ok any changes in your bowel movements no ok any changes in your urination no ok any changes at all in your sleep uhm just been well i have not been sleeping as well waking up all sweaty and the cough is kept me up a little bit too ok any changes in your appetite no i have been eating ok have you noticed at all any weight loss over the last few months yeah i think i am down like \u00a315 since the summer time which is great ok have you tried to lose weight at all or is it just been completely unintentional well i i mean my my appendix was taken out a few months ago and so i guess after that i well maybe was not eating and eating as much but i mean i was not really trying to lose weight ok and have you had any recent exposure to any fumes or dust or animals no my my parents have a dog at home but i have been away at school so ok ok in terms of your overall health have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before no i am healthy so like no asthma or anything like that no nothing like that ok are you on any medications currently yeah i take an oral contraceptive pill ok and when did you start that probably about 5 years ago ok do you have any allergies to any medications or any environmental allergies at all yeah i think septra gives me a rash ok any previous hospitalizations no i have never been in the hospital before ok any previous surgery so you said you had the appendix removed but anything else no the appendix was the only thing ok any family history of asthma or any lung conditions any cancers that run in the family yeah but well my grandfather had lung cancer but he smoked for his entire life and my mom has had diabetes for quite some time but no no lung problems ok any heart attacks in the family or any autoimmune conditions no ok and currently what is your living situation like so i live with 4 roommates here going to school ok and so do you work right now or you just a student right now just a student ok and currently do you smoke uhm i smoke maybe maybe socially so maybe a pack of cigarettes a week at the at the most ok and any recreational drug use like marijuana yeah i will smoke one or 2 joints on on the weekend with friends socially ok yeah so yeah this the smoking marijuana or cigarettes make your symptoms worse at all uhm it depends yeah sometimes i can it can bring on some more coughing yeah so yeah we always recommend cutting down or quitting smoking whenever whenever we see patients who are smoking especially like you are fairly young and you know your grandfather had history of lung cancer with smoking throughout the year so as early as we can quit smoking the better for the long term health of your lungs but whenever you are thinking of quitting or if you want any more resources about quitting just let me know we can set up a separate appointment for that ok that that sounds good yeah maybe maybe next appointment we can talk about that ok sounds good any so no recreational so just besides marijuana any other recreational drugs like cocaine or crystal meth anything of that sort ah no well sometimes i at parties maybe a few times a year with friends will use ecstasy or something like that but that is only a few times a year ok and any alcohol yeah i will have a few drinks on the weekend with with friends usually like rum or beer ok yeah so this is all the questions i had for you today any any questions or concerns or any ideas of what you think this might be uhm i do not know i am really concerned about the the blood that i brought up like i mean is this cancer or tuberculosis like one of those tuberculosis infections that i heard about while i was away yeah so definitely a cancer is pretty unlikely because you are fairly young and you have just recently started smoking but one of the things that we are concerned about is your recent travel history being in close quarters so definitely we need to get a chest x ray and we can even do a sputum culture to test for tuberculosis and then based on the results we might have to start you on like a whole antibiotic regiment if it does come back as tuberculosis yeah we will we will we will get those investigations done 1st and then we will go from there ok thank you we will also get some blood work done as well so that will be done before your next appointment alright that sounds good thank you you are welcome",
