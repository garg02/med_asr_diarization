And any concerns for like exposures while you're at work in terms like breathing in any dusts or any fumes.\n\n\nP: Um were given a um personal protective equipment um for those concerns, but when I was younger I used to work a in shipyards and constructions and like old buildings and stuff, and I know there was some concern for not being ah properly equipped with the right equipment for protection and safety at that point so. Uh yeah, it's possible. I've been exposed to some things.\n\n\nD: I see is there a chance that there could have been asbestos at any of those places that you worked?\n\n\nP: Yeah, asbestos or mold.
