More irritable, anything like that?\n\nP: Yeah, she's been a, maybe a bit more, maybe a bit more tired and and a bit more irritable, but not not too bad.

She's been gaining weight well.\n\nD: OK, any exposure to any allergens or like fumes, dust animals?\n\nP: No, I can't think of anything like that. We don't have any pets at Home and she's she's been hasn't been going anywhere else.\n\nD: OK, has she been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?\n\nP: No, she just said, ah, just yeah had a urinary tract infection when she was younger and that's about it. \n\nD: OK.

Did you feel any pressure in around her face at all? \n\nP: Uh, yeah, well yeah, I think so. She doesn't say, well, no pain but does feel like a bit of pressure with the congestion, I think.\n\nD: OK, uhm any issues developmentally as she was growing up like to meet are all our milestones at an appropriate age?\n\nP: She did yeah, she has met she was walking at the appropriate times and able to talk and does work really well in school and is social with with her classmates and peers. \n\nD: So no, no issues or no complaints at all?\n\nP: No, there hasn't been any concerns.

And it's been, it's been you said three or four days in total, right?\n\nP: Yeah yeah.\n\nD: Yeah, and so most likely it's just caused by a viral infection like common cold perhaps, it she doesn't have any worrying signs of any systemic things going on right now, so and no signs of like a bacterial infection that I would be concerned about that I would give antibiotics for right now. But definitely if her symptoms get worse at home and if she starts having any kind of shortness of breath, increased coughing with producing, more yellow or green material and if she gets more feverish, so will also do a physical exam and take her temperature today as well. But yeah, some of these things you just look out for, but yeah, so that that we'll do the physical examination and go from there.\n\nP: Alright, thank you. \n\nD: Hey, you're welcome. Take care.",
