been ok ok and how about do you have any sensation of palpitations or your heart is racing at all no i have not felt anything like that ok and any kind of diarrhea or constipation no ok any issues with urination no no problems there any changes in your sleep or appetite no that that has been pretty good ok any night sweats no i have not had any night sweats ok any kind of significant weight change recently i i i might have no i think my weight has been about the same ok any exposure to anyone sick around you recently no i do not think so but i i have had i have had a couple of chest colds over the last year that i needed antibiotics for and it they they went away after that i got that those from a walk in clinic sorry you got antibiotics from the walk in clinic yeah the last time was probably about about 4 months ago ok so i have not been around anybody sick recently but but i mean i i have had similar symptoms before i feel like this time might be just a bit worse though ok and do you have any past medical history any conditions you have been diagnosed with yeah so i i have been i have been diagnosed with copd as well as high blood pressure and gerd ok and when were you diagnosed with copd about 3 years ago 3 years ago ok do you take any medications for any of these conditions yeah so i have a medication ventolin i take symbicort daily which is like a steroid type medication and then i take an ace inhibitor i think for blood pressure and just tums or something like that if my reflux is bad ok and do you have any allergies to any medications no no ok any past hospitalizations or surgeries no ok any family history of any medical conditions any lung or heart conditions nothing like that no ok and any cancers in the family no ok and any currently right now what is your living situation like yeah so i am living with with just my daughter in a in an apartment ok and currently do you work yeah so i i have been working at the at the grocery store yeah i have been at the grocery store ok and do you smoke currently i do yeah i smoke about a pack a day and i i have smoked for now well probably like 30 or 40 years i used to smoke more ok you have cut down that is good yeah definitely the more you cut down and if you need to talk about quitting there is a lot of resources that we can go through do you use anything else besides cigarettes like any marijuana or any other drugs no no just just cigarettes ok and any alcohol yeah i mean i will have some wine with dinner on the weekends but that is about it ok alright so those are all the questions i had for you do you have any questions no that was about it i was i was wondering if you think i i have an infection or is this copd acting up or what is going on yeah so definitely with your history of copd and these symptoms it can just be an exacerbation of your copd and that can happen sometimes when you have copd and then you get a either viral or bacterial infection and that makes your symptoms worse and you have also had a fever so we will do like a full physical examination get your vitals everything but and then we will give you some like nebulized like for your home puffers too but all just in the hospital and monitor your response to them and then we will also get like your some of your blood work and chest x ray just to see if there is any like pneumonia and lastly we will just get like a covid swab done since some of these symptoms also overlap with covid symptoms and yeah so we will so that is what we will do and i will let the emergency department know that you are on your way i think you will need to get all those tests there and then they will decide whether or not you need any kind of admission or you can just go home on antibiotics from there ok ok that sounds good thank you yeah yeah alright take care bye",
