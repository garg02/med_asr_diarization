And with this headache when it first came on, did you experience a like worst headache of your life, or a Thunder clap sensation?\n\nP: No, it's it's not that bad, but it just seems to be there all day long.\n\nD: OK, um have you had headaches like this before?\n\nP: No, I've never gotten headaches in the past.\n\nD: OK, uh is the headache associated with any nausea or vomiting? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and is the headache worse in the morning when you first wake up?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and does it have to get worse if you lie flat?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and has this headache been getting worse, staying the same, getting better?\n\nP: It's it's about the same.\n\nD: OK.

Not that I've noticed, no.\n\nD: OK, is there anything in regards to your past health that you see a physician regularly for? \n\nP: Um No. Ah actually I I think at one point, um, I was worked up for something called familial hypercholesterolemia because it ran in the family. But I think those results were normal.\n\nD: OK, so do you, um, do you take a statin medication then?\n\nP: Yeah I take a low dose statin. \n\nD: OK, and when was your last lipid panel checked?\n\nP: I think it was two years ago. \n\nD: I see, and um do you remember if the LDL was normal at that time?\n\nP: Ah yes it was normal.\n\nD: OK, but since the, it was about two years ago, it might be worthwhile today just to also check a lipid panel just to be safe, but that'll be something we can talk about that more so at the end if that's OK.\n\nP: Sure, yeah, that would be great.\n\nD: OK, and any other medical conditions?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. Have you had any surgeries before?\n\nP: C-section.\n\nD: How many children do you have?\n\nP: Ah just the one. \n\nD: OK, and were there any complications with the c-section?\n\nP: Um no no complications.\n\nD: OK, any reasons for hospitalizations?\n\nP: Nope. \n\nD: OK, any allergies to medications?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Alright, any medications besides the statin that you take?\n\nP: Nope.\n\nD: OK, and in regards to your family history, have there been people who've had early heart attacks or strokes in the family?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, but you do have familial hypercholesterolemia, do you have family members who have that?\n\nP: Yes OK so my Aunts had it, as well as my mother.\n\nD: OK um. And has there been any lung conditions that run in the family?\n\nP: Um, no lung conditions.\n\nD: How about any malignancy's or or cancers?\n\nP: Ah there was colon cancer on my dad side of the family, but I'm not too sure who had it.\n\nD: OK, have you heard of anybody having breast cancer?\n\nP: Breast cancer no.\n\nD: Alright, and how about ovarian cancer?\n\nP: No ovarian cancer. \n\nD: OK. And next I actually wanted to ask a few questions about your personal and lifestyle habits, but first, could you just tell me a little bit about your living situation right now?\n\nP: I live with my husband and my one son.\n\nD: OK, and sorry, how old is your son?\n\nP: He is 10. \n\nD: OK, um is anybody in the home been sick recently?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and how about is there anybody at work? \n\nP: At work no. No one's been sick.\n\nD: OK, have you traveled anywhere recently?\n\nP: We went up to we just went to um like a, we went on a hiking trail that was outside the city recently and there were a lot of people there and and we weren't wearing masks, but we, it seemed like we were keeping a good distance between each other so that that would be my only concern.\n\nD: OK for sure. Were people pretty close to each other on the paths when walking by on the hike?\n\nP: Ahh not like the whole time, but there would be times when you know people just kind of brushed by you to try to get ahead of you or something like that. \n\nD: I see OK. And do you smoke cigarettes? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Um, do you smoke marijuana?\n\nP: Um no. \n\nD: OK, and do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: I don't.\n\nD: Do you use any other recreational drugs?\n\nP: Um no.\n\nD: OK, so that was all I wanted to ask about. Oh, actually one thing that I I did want to, I forgot to ask was, do you have any neck stiffness?\n\nP: No, not that I noticed. \n\nD: OK. So that was the last question that I wanted to ask about. Was there anything that you wanted to tell me that I I maybe forgot?\n\nP: No, I think you covered it all.  I'm just wondering do you? Do you think it's COVID or something else?\n\nD: Well, it's definitely a possibility with the symptoms that you're having, since they can be so non- specific for covid it can be a lot of symptoms that overlap. So with having headache what sounds like you might have a fever and and this cough that sounds like it's pretty bad if you're bringing up some blood, it sounds like you might have irritated some of the bronchioles with the the coughing. So we will test for that and check a PCR nasal swab for COVID. I'm not, but we will also test for other viral illnesses and bacterial illnesses as well. It doesn't sound like you have meningitis right now just based on the symptoms where you don't have neck stiffness, but it'll be certainly something that we keep keep in mind while we are doing our investigations. \n\nP: OK great, thank you.\n\nD: Alright, you're welcome. We'll get those started.\n\nP: OK, sounds great.\n\n",

been getting worse staying the same getting better it is it is about the same ok and and you have not checked the temperature yet you said but you felt hot yes that is right ok any other symptoms that you have been experiencing not that i can think of ok there is just a few others that i wanted to ask about to be comprehensive have you had any eye pain or ear pain no how about any discharge from either your eyes or ears no nothing like that alright have you had any changes to either your sense of smell or your sense of taste no alright and have you had a runny nose at all no and how about a

about any fainting spells or feeling like you might faint no nothing like that ok and have you had any abdominal pain no no abdominal pain any diarrhea or constipation no how about any painful urination or feeling as though you need to urinate really frequently ah no nothing like that ok and have you had any skin changes like rashes or anything like that no ok and how about any muscle aches or joint aches or just overall like body pains no not that i that not not that i have noticed no ok is there anything in regards to your past health that you see a physician regularly for no ah actually i i think at one point i was worked up for something called familial hypercholesterolemia because it ran in the family but i think those results were normal ok so do you do you take a statin medication then yeah i take a low dose statin ok and when was your last lipid panel checked i think it was 2 years ago i see and do you remember if the ldl was normal at that time ah yes it was normal ok but since the it was about 2 years ago it might be worthwhile today just to also check a lipid panel just to be safe but that will be something we can talk about that more so at the end if that is ok sure yeah that would be great ok and any other medical conditions no ok have you had any surgeries before c section how many children do you have ah just the one ok and were there any complications with the c section no no complications ok any reasons for hospitalizations nope ok any allergies to medications no alright any medications besides the statin that you take nope ok and in regards to your family history have there been people who have had early heart attacks or strokes in the family no ok but you do have familial hypercholesterolemia do you have family members who have that yes ok so my aunts had it as well as my mother ok and has there been any lung conditions that run in the family no lung conditions how about any malignancy is or or cancers ah there was colon cancer on my dad side of the family but i am not too sure who had it ok have you heard of anybody having breast cancer breast cancer no alright and how about ovarian cancer no ovarian cancer ok and next i actually wanted to ask a few questions about your personal and lifestyle habits but 1st could you just tell me a little bit about your living situation right now i live with my husband and my one son ok and sorry how old is your son he is 10 ok is anybody in the home been sick recently no ok and how about is there anybody at work at work no no one has been sick ok have you traveled anywhere recently we went up to we just went to like a we went on a hiking trail that was outside the city recently and there were a lot of people there and and we were not wearing masks but we it seemed like we were keeping a good distance between each other so that that would be my only concern ok for sure were people pretty close to each other on the paths when walking by on the hike ahh not like the whole time but there would be times when you know people just kind of brushed by you to try to get ahead of you or something like that i see ok and do you smoke cigarettes no do you smoke marijuana no ok and do you drink alcohol i do not do you use any other recreational drugs no ok so that was all i wanted to ask about 0 actually one thing that i i did want to i forgot to ask was do you have any neck stiffness no not that i noticed ok so that was the last question that i wanted to ask about was there anything that you wanted to tell me that i i maybe forgot no i think you covered it all i am just wondering do you do you think it is covid or something else well it is definitely a possibility with the symptoms that you are having since they can be so non specific for covid it can be a lot of symptoms that overlap so with having headache what sounds like you might have a fever and and this cough that sounds like it is pretty bad if you are bringing up some blood it sounds like you might have irritated some of the bronchioles with the the coughing so we will test for that and check a pcr nasal swab for covid i am not but we will also test for other viral illnesses and bacterial illnesses as well it does not sound like you have meningitis right now just based on the symptoms where you do not have neck stiffness but it will be certainly something that we keep keep in mind while we are doing our investigations ok great thank you alright you are welcome we will get those started ok sounds great",
