    "ref": "D: So what brings you here today at the family clinic?\n\nP: I haven't been coughing these last two weeks since I got back from Mexico. I think I got sick there.\n\nD: OK, so just the last couple weeks you've been coughing?\n\nP: Yeah, ever since I got back from Mexico it's been yeah so about about two weeks.\n\nD: OK. And is your cough for a wet cough or dry cough?\n\nP: It's dry and I'm not bringing up any any sputum.\n\nD: OK, and are you coughing up any blood at all?\n\nP: No blood.\n\nD: No, OK. And is the cough constant or does it come and go?\n\nP: It, it comes and goes. I would say sometimes it can be worse. Yeah, depending on on what I'm what I'm doing. I guess if I'm exercising or if it's if it's really cold outside, it might get worse. \n\nD: OK. And do you feel that it's been getting worse at all, your cough? \n\nP: Uh, not really, I think it's about the same.\n\nD: OK, and anything that you did when you were in Mexico that might you think might have caused your cough?\n\nP: Uh, I don't know, maybe I, I was drinking a little bit too much and partying a little bit too much so might have got sick while I was there.\n\nD: I see. Did you have any cold symptoms like runny nose, sore throat? Um, any anything like that when you were there or after you came back?\n\nP: No, sometimes my eyes can get a little itchy, but no runny nose or sore throat.\n\nD: OK, have you had any previous episodes that are similar to how you're feeling now?\n\nP: Uh, maybe years ago when I like when I was in elementary school, but nothing for the last few years.\n\nD: OK, and how often are you coughing? Let's say in an average day?\n\nP: Um, it's uh, it's pretty variable. I would say, so if I'm exercising it will it'll throw me into a coughing fit and and sometimes it's really bugging me at night too it'll affect me. It's impairing my sleep.\n\nD: OK, and so exercise makes it worse. Anything that you do that helps you relieve the cough?\n\nP: Uhm, I actually I tried my sons inhaler and it seemed to actually help, but one of the days I just couldn't seem to stop the cough and I wanted to sleep so I gave it a try and it it seemed to actually help with the cough.\n\nD: OK, and so your son has inhalers, does he have asthma? \n\nP: Yeah he does. Yeah he was diagnosed with asthma a couple of years ago.\n\nD: OK, and have you previously been diagnosed with asthma?\n\nP: Ah I think if they've said it before when I was young, but I haven't had any symptoms for for for years.\n\nD: OK, and besides the cough, do you have any other symptoms, like any cold symptoms of runny nose, sore throat right now, or even like any chest pain?\n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK. And do you have any symptoms like a headache or nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: Uh, nope. No headache, nausea or vomiting.\n\nD: OK. Is your cough at all worse during the day or at night? Or does it just is at around the same throughout the day?\n\nP: I think the coughs worse at night.\n\nD: OK.

And how long you've had those cats for?\n\nP: We've had them for for almost a year.\n\nD: OK. And other than eczema and remote history of perhaps asthma when you were younger, any other medical conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure that you've been diagnosed with?\n\nP: No, I've been healthy that way.\n\nD: OK.

Everyone's healthy.\n\nD: OK and currently what is your living situation like?\n\nP: Yeah, so I live in an apartment nearby with my boyfriend.\n\nD: OK, and has there been any, have you moved there recently or how long have you lived there for?\n\nP: Uh we've lived there for about four years now. \n\nD: Four years, OK.

I made, it was a New Year's resolution to quit.\n\nD: Oh wow, well congratulations, that's it's definitely very difficult to quit. And if you need at all, any help at all with your transition at all, we can always bring it up in any appointment.\n\nP: OK, thank you.\n\nD: Yeah. And in terms of recreational drugs, do you use marijuana or cocaine or any other recreational drugs?\n\nP: Um, yeah, maybe I'll I'll smoke like one or two joints a week.\n\nD: OK. And do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: Uh, yeah, maybe a bottle of wine on the weekends.\n\nD: OK. Uhm, so you go through like around a bottle every week?\n\nP: Yeah, I would say about a bottle of wine on throughout the week, but usually don't really have any during the week, I'll usually, I guess, split the bottle between between Friday to Sunday sort of thing.\n\nD: OK. And in terms of exercise, do you find that you're getting adequate exercise throughout the week?\n\nP: I tried to, I tried to run and go for walks but always trying to be a little bit more active.\n\nD: OK. Alright, so yeah those are all the questions I had for you today. Um, do you have any other questions for me?\n\nP: Uhm, nope, that was it.\n\nD: OK, so based on what we talked about, it seems that based on your past history and the coughing that you're having right now, one of the things that we definitely want to look at is if you do in fact have asthma. Um, it can also be like viral upper respiratory tract infection, but we will do some pulmonary function tests for you and see if the bronchodilators just like you use the inhaler from your son if that helps helps you with your symptoms and then we can go from there.\n\nP: That sounds great. Thank you.\n\nD: You're welcome. Well, take care.\n\n",

you have been coughing yeah ever since i got back from mexico it has been yeah so about about 2 weeks ok and is your cough for a wet cough or dry cough it is dry and i am not bringing up any any sputum ok and are you coughing up any blood at all no blood no ok and is the cough constant or does it come and go it it comes and goes i would say sometimes it can be worse yeah depending on on what i am what i am doing i guess if i am exercising or if it is if it is really cold outside it might get worse ok and do you feel that it has been getting worse at all your cough not really i think it is about the same ok and anything that you did when you were in mexico that might you think might have caused your cough i do not know maybe i i was drinking a little bit too much and partying a little bit too much so might have got sick while i was there i see did you have any cold symptoms like runny nose sore throat any anything like that when you were there or after you came back no sometimes my eyes can get a little itchy but no runny nose or sore throat ok have you had any previous episodes that are similar to how you are feeling now maybe years ago when i like when i was in elementary school but nothing for the last few years ok and how often are you coughing let us say in an average day it is it is pretty variable i would say so if i am exercising it will it will throw me into a coughing fit and and sometimes it is really bugging me at night too it will affect me it is impairing my sleep ok and so exercise makes it worse anything that you do that helps you relieve the cough uhm i actually i tried my sons inhaler and it seemed to actually help but one of the days i just could not seem to stop the cough and i wanted to sleep so i gave it a try and it it seemed to actually help with the cough ok and so your son has inhalers does he have asthma yeah he does yeah he was diagnosed with asthma a couple of years ago ok and have you previously been diagnosed with asthma ah i think if they have said it before when i was young but i have not had any symptoms for for for years ok and besides the cough do you have any other symptoms like any cold symptoms of runny nose sore throat right now or even like any chest pain no nothing like that ok and do you have any symptoms like a headache or nausea or vomiting nope no headache nausea or vomiting ok is your cough at all worse during the day or at night or does it just is at around the same throughout the day i think the coughs worse at night ok and do you ever feel that you are short of breath at all well yeah so it affects me if i am outside and that that is actually usually when my eyes will get itchy too ok and have you had any eczema in the past yeah i had i had eczema when i was i was younger i think that was in it when i was in elementary school as well ok have you had any fevers or chills recently no any night sweats no have you been feeling increasingly tired throughout the day ah no my energy has been been good i just get short of breath or or have these coughing fits if i if i exert myself ok have you noticed any swelling in your feet or hands no any dizziness no dizziness do you ever feel your heart is racing when you get like these thumping like heart palpitations nothing like that ok and you said no chest pain right no chest pain ok have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements any constipation or diarrhea no diarrhea ok any changes in your urinary patterns no everything has been normal ok so you mentioned like the coughs been keeping you up at night how how often are you waking up at night is it pretty frequent i would say about 2 or 3 nights a week over these last 2 weeks it has been it has been getting worse ok and have you noticed any changes in your weight at all my weight has been about the same ok any changes in your appetite no been eating well ok any recent exposures to anyone with tuberculosis that you know of no no ok have you lost your sense of taste or smell recently neither of those ok and have you been exposed to any fumes or dust in your surrounding area or do you have any pets or animals at home yeah we have a 2 cats and but nothing at work ok and how long you have had those cats for we have had them for for almost a year ok and other than eczema and remote history of perhaps asthma when you were younger any other medical conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure that you have been diagnosed with no i have been healthy that way ok any medications that you are on currently no medications ok do you know of any allergies to any environmental exposures or any medications at all uhm yeah i think i have i am allergic to pollen and some other environmental and allergies as well ok and when you cough have you ever noticed like wheezing noises at all occasionally yeah there though i do notice a wheeze ok and have you ever been hospitalized before no i have not ok any previous surgeries no surgeries ok and has anyone around you been ill recently everybody has been healthy ok and do you have any family history of cancers or anything related to the lungs at all no i mean my sister had eczema as well but that is it ok that is it ok any heart attacks in your family any other medical conditions no everyone is healthy ok and currently what is your living situation like yeah so i live in an apartment nearby with my boyfriend ok and has there been any have you moved there recently or how long have you lived there for we have lived there for about 4 years now 4 years ok and has anything changed recently has there been any mold or new carpets that you guys got anything new in the house uhm i do not i do not think so ok and do you currently work yeah i work as a a school teacher ok and do you smoke at all no i do not have you ever smoked i did yeah i i smoked a pack a day up until just about a month ago i made it was a new year is resolution to quit 0 wow well congratulations that is it is definitely very difficult to quit and if you need at all any help at all with your transition at all we can always bring it up in any appointment ok thank you yeah and in terms of recreational drugs do you use marijuana or cocaine or any other recreational drugs yeah maybe i will i will smoke like one or 2 joints a week ok and do you drink alcohol yeah maybe a bottle of wine on the weekends ok uhm so you go through like around a bottle every week yeah i would say about a bottle of wine on throughout the week but usually do not really have any during the week i will usually i guess split the bottle between between friday to sunday sort of thing ok and in terms of exercise do you find that you are getting adequate exercise throughout the week i tried to i tried to run and go for walks but always trying to be a little bit more active ok alright so yeah those are all the questions i had for you today do you have any other questions for me uhm nope that was it ok so based on what we talked about it seems that based on your past history and the coughing that you are having right now one of the things that we definitely want to look at is if you do in fact have asthma it can also be like viral upper respiratory tract infection but we will do some pulmonary function tests for you and see if the bronchodilators just like you use the inhaler from your son if that helps helps you with your symptoms and then we can go from there that sounds great thank you you are welcome well take care",
