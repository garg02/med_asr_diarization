And how about pain with pronation and supination?\n\nP: With pronation it hurts.\n\nD: OK, at the medial side? \n\nP: Yes.\n\nD: OK and how about with wrist. So with resisted uh, yeah, wrist flexion?\n\nP: Wrist flexion yeah. That hurts too.\n\nD: OK, and then how about if you passively extend your your wrist as far down as as you can go?\n\nP: Down uh yes. That hurts too. \n\nD: OK. And is there any numbness or tingling anywhere?\n\nP: No, no, no numbness or tingling. \n\nD: OK. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention?\n\nP: No, that was that. What do you think I have and how can I fix it?\n\nD: Yeah, so it. It's certainly it it sounds like with the medial aspect of your elbow having pain there over the last several months and some of the physical exam maneuvers, such as like passive wrist extension, resisted wrist flexion as well as pronation and the point tenderness over the medial elbow this could be a medial epicondylitis or a tendinopathy in that area. And so this is typically treated with activity modification, so this could be trying to avoid repetitive movements that that cause pain. And using medications such as Advil and Tylenol and doing strengthening and stretching exercises, which you can learn from a physiotherapist or or on your own as well. And also other things that that the medial side of the elbow that it could be is an ulnar ligament injury. Um or yeah, or the other thing to be considering is and ulnar ligament injury and so if the pain isn't going away, then we might consider an ultrasound or something to look at the structures there.\n\nP: OK, that sounds great. Thank you.\n",

multivitamins ok and do you have any allergies to medications no ok and have you had any hospitalizations or prior surgeries i i had a fracture when i was younger it was in my humerus bone on the right side ok so it is the to the fracture was on the other arm yes ok and did that heal ok yes alright then can you tell me about your living situation currently like whereabouts and who you are living with i live with my partner of 5 years we live in an apartment together ok and are you working currently i am and what do you do i work on the assembly line for chrysler ok and do you do repetitive tasks at work i do ok yeah do you notice this pain after more so after a shift or after after a long day yes definitely ok and what types of hobbies do you have like do you play golf or tennis or or any kind of like sports i guess yeah i used to play golf before this pain in my arm and my elbow so i have not played it in the past like 6 months ok ok and do you smoke cigarettes i do not and do you drink alcohol i will have a glass of wine every other day ok and how about the use of any recreational drugs like cannabis or or anything else i will smoke a joint once a week ok alright and is there any family history of any heart or lung problems no any musculoskeletal or neurological diseases no ok i got any autoimmune diseases like thyroid disease or diabetes no ok and so next i wanted to walk through a physical exam so when you look at the elbow yourself do you see any swelling or redness no ok does it look like there is any muscle atrophy either in the forearm or the biceps or triceps no ok and how about any misalignment or joint deformity no i do not see any of that ok and are there any scars no ok and when you press on the medial part of the the elbow do you feel pain i do how about over the olecranon or the yea any pain over the olecranon a little bit ok and is there any pain over the lateral part of the elbow no ok an any pain over the forearm or biceps or triceps muscles no ok and does the joint feel like it is hot no ok and any pain with shoulder or elbow movements no ok actually sorry with the elbow when i straighten it out all the way it hurts a little bit ok when are you straightening it out all the way ok but no pain with shoulder movements and full range of motion no no pain with shoulder ok and how about pain with pronation and supination with pronation it hurts ok at the medial side yes ok and how about with wrist so with resisted yeah wrist flexion wrist flexion yeah that hurts too ok and then how about if you passively extend your your wrist as far down as as you can go down yes that hurts too ok and is there any numbness or tingling anywhere no no no numbness or tingling ok ok so that was everything that i wanted to ask about today was there anything else that you wanted to mention no that was that what do you think i have and how can i fix it yeah so it it is certainly it it sounds like with the medial aspect of your elbow having pain there over the last several months and some of the physical exam maneuvers such as like passive wrist extension resisted wrist flexion as well as pronation and the point tenderness over the medial elbow this could be a medial epicondylitis or a tendinopathy in that area and so this is typically treated with activity modification so this could be trying to avoid repetitive movements that that cause pain and using medications such as advil and tylenol and doing strengthening and stretching exercises which you can learn from a physiotherapist or or on your own as well and also other things that that the medial side of the elbow that it could be is an ulnar ligament injury or yeah or the other thing to be considering is and ulnar ligament injury and so if the pain is not going away then we might consider an ultrasound or something to look at the structures there ok that sounds great thank you",
