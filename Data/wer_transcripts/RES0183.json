And sorry, just to go back and just summarize the symptoms overall, so he's had a \"barky\" cough that started two days ago, as well as some stridor or some noise on inhalation. And, and this reminds me, has he had any fevers or chills?\n\nP: Uh, he has had a fever. Actually it was 38.7 yesterday.\n\nD: OK, and any night sweats?\n\nP: No, hasn't seemed sweaty at night, no.\n\nD: OK. And has he had any weight loss in the last, several months?\n\nP: Uh, no. \n\nD: OK. And you said he hasn't been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, but so, has he had any reasons to be hospitalized or or any surgeries?\n\nP: No, it's been a pretty healthy child.\n\nD: OK, that's great, and any allergies that you're aware of?\n\nP: Uh, I think he's allergic to penicillin.\n\nD: Alright, what's the reaction?\n\nP: Uh, he just gets a rash.\n\nD: OK. And  are his immunizations up to date? \n\nP: Yes. \n\nD: Alright, and currently who is he living with?\n\nP: Ah, he lives with his, both his parents and his older sister.\n\nD: OK, and has anybody in the family been sick, or is he been around anybody who's been sick?\n\nP: No, everyone's been pretty healthy. \n\nD: OK. Has there been any travel recently?\n\nP: No, no ones traveled recently.\n\nD: OK, and anybody smoke in the home?\n\nP: Uh, no. \n\nD: Alright, then any concerns for him being exposed to any forms of physical or emotional or verbal abuse or any violence in the home?\n\nP: Oh no, no.\n\nD: OK. And is he like going to daycare or who is the primary caregiver at home?\n\nP: Uhm, it's usually his, his mom, yeah. \n\nD: OK. And were there any complications throughout pregnancy, such as gestational diabetes or high blood pressure? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Alright, and any complications with delivery and was it vaginal or C-section?\n\nP: It was vaginal and no, no no complications.\n\nD: Alright, and up to this point, as you better meeting is milestones for like talking, walking and and things like that?\n\nP: Yeah, that's right. \n\nD: OK, and uh, any concerns for his vision or hearing?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and has he been growing normally? \n\nP: Yeah, he's had all his milestones.\n\nD: Excellent, OK. And are there any conditions in the family such as heart or lung disease?\n\nP: Oh, no. \n\nD: OK. How about ah, asthma or things like allergic rhinitis and allergies?\n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK. Uhm, so I I think that was all the questions that I wanted to ask today on history. Was there anything else that I maybe forgot to ask about or or that you wanted to mention?\n\nP: Uh, no, that was kind of it. What should I do for him?\n\nD: Uhm, so it's it sounds like the most likely diagnosis now is something called Croup or laryngeal tracheal bronchitis, which is basically a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract areas, and so it can cause had a barky cough and stridor and fever. And so, if so, it's really supportive care and unless he decompensate's and becomes really short of breath and worse, in which case we could, the treatment would be steroids and uhm, possibly utilizing other other things as well, depending on his symptoms, but usually it will be steroids and maybe some oxygen as well. But if he stays relatively stable, then it's mostly supportive care, just making sure he's hydrated as much as possible, you could use like humidified air. Sometimes like a hot shower. That sort of thing can maybe help relieve the cough at night.\n\nP: OK. \n\nD: But umm, that's about it. \n\nP: OK.\n\nD: We'll, so, we'll so we'll just observe for now.\n\nP: OK, that sounds good.
