I actually was riding my bicycle and just fell off on, kind of just slipped and I think I fell on that side like when I the impact was right on my chest and since then it's been really painful.\n\nD: OK I am how would you describe the pain, sometimes people will use words like burning dull, achy.\n\nP: I think it's more like someone is just stabbing me and then whole left side area.\n\nD: OK, and um. Anything that you've been doing that's that's made the pain worse?\n\nP: If I. Think I have to take really really slow and shallow breaths. If I try to take a deep breath it just really hurts like taking those small, smaller breaths helps.\n\nD: OK, and do you feel the pain anywhere else, or is it just on the left side of your chest?\n\nP: No, I would say just on the left side.\n\nD: OK, and has the pain been getting worse, staying the same or getting better?\n\nP: I'd say over the last two hours it's been getting worse.\n\nD: OK, and do you have any other associated symptoms?\n\nP: Uh, like I think I I'm having. Also maybe it's just because I'm trying to breathe slowly, but I feel like I can't catch my breath.\n\nD: OK, um has anything like this ever happened to you before?\n\nP: No, no. I mean, I've never had any pain in my chest before.\n\nD: OK are you, did you have a loss of consciousness when you fell off your bike?\n\nP: No, I got right back up.

No, no cough or no infections.\n\nD: OK, and uh, any dizziness?\n\nP: Um no.\n\nD: Alright, and I know you mentioned the few scratches on your hands, but any other injuries? \n\nP: Oh no, I I think I got a pretty lucky.\n\nD: Oh, OK.

No no drugs or alcohol.\n\nD: OK, and any weakness or numbness or tingling that you noticed?\n\nP: Um no nothing like that.\n\nD: Alright, and, when was the last time you had anything to eat or drink?\n\nP: I just had some cereal and, um, just some chocolate milk around breakfast time but nothing else.\n\nD: OK, and how many hours ago was that?\n\nP: I would say around 3 hours ago.\n\nD: OK. Um, and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?\n\nP: Uh, not other than just a hay fever, but nothing nothing else. I have like a lot of allergies.\n\nD: Any allergies to medications?\n\nP: Oh, just sometimes when I take like a nasal spray I think I might have an allergy to the steroids that they give me and sometimes also some of the antihistamines I think I get some allergies from them.\n\nD: OK.

I live alone in an apartment, so I'm doing fairly well.\n\nD: OK, and do you smoke?\n\nP: I smoke around like I'd say 2 and a half to 3 packs per day. I know it's.
