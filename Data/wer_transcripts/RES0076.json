in a home and who do you live with i live in a home with my wife and it is just us 2 and do you know if there is any like asbestos exposure in your home at all i do not think so no ok and currently do you smoke i have been cutting down but i do smoke yes i smoke about a half a pack per day now there was a time i was smoking 2 packs per day for a number of years and i started smoking when i was probably 15 yeah so it has been about 40 yeah 40 ish years at least and have you thought of quitting at all yeah i have been trying i was thinking of maybe talking about a prescription for helping quit or something like that today i was feeling like this is causing some of my symptoms like my cough shortness of breath yeah well it is really great that you are thinking about quitting we can definitely help you with some resources and some medications have you tried anything before that i should know of to help you quit i have tried nicotine patches and gum but that is it ok so yeah there is like other options as well that you can take have you heard of champix i did hear of it actually yeah so one of my friends tried it and it worked well for them so yeah ok yeah so we can if you are wondering about that i can give you some information on that medication like a whole package for you and then we can discuss if that could work for you that sounds great ok sweet and other than smoking do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana no i do not ok and do you drink alcohol well i will have one or 2 beers on the weekend ok alright so yeah that is pretty much all the questions i had right now it seems that your symptoms you do have that cough and the shortness of breath and it has been chronic but now you are coughing up some blood as well so that is definitely something that is concerning and we want to make sure there is nothing going on so we will get a chest x ray for you and see if we can find anything there are still producing the bloody sputum yeah that has been coming up a daily still ok so if you think you can produce that we can even take a sample of that as well and see if there is any presence the one thing that we are concerned about with some of your symptoms and a long history of smoking as well is lung cancer so yeah we will do a chest x ray get some cytology done as well and then once we have that in the future we may need to maybe do a biopsy but right now we will do a few of the 1st things that i mentioned and then go from there that sounds good thank you you are welcome take care bye",
