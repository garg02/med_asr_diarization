And so that I that was everything I wanted to ask on history. So for the physical exam, when inspecting the knee, are you seeing any joint effusions or joint swelling or ecchymosis or bruising?\n\nP: It looks or is that a bruise, it looks red and I would say it's a little bit swollen on the medial aspect only.\n\nD: OK, is there any muscle atrophy?\n\nP: Um no. \n\nD: OK, and is there any misalignment or joint deformities?\n\nP: No, not that I notice. \n\nD: OK. And alright on gait or walking, is there any limp or antalgia? \n\nP: Um no.\n\nD: You're able to walk normally?\n\nP: I am able to walk normally and it hurts, but I think I'm walking OK. \n\nD: OK. Uhm and next is there any changes to temperature like the joint itself feel hot?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK and are there any areas of the joint line itself of the knee that is painful to palpation?\n\nP: At just the medial part of it like the I guess where the ligament would be.\n\nD: OK, so just let me OK, and, any pain over the patella?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Any pain over the tibial tuberosity or patellar tendon?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any pain over your over the fibular head or the lateral part of the knee?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any pain in the calf or the thigh muscles?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any pain in the hamstring muscles?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and is there any pain to a like varus stress of the knee?\n\nP: To the varus stress? I guess it would be, there will be pain if I press down in that area.\n\nD: OK, and is there any joint yeah, the joint laxity or pain too, like a valgus stress of the knee?\n\nP: Yeah, so when I press when I do that it hurts on the medial aspect but not the lateral aspect. \n\nD: OK. Uhm and does it feel is as though there's some like the joints opening more when you put the valgus stress? \n\nP: A little bit, yes.\n\nD: OK. Uhm and is there any instability moving the tibia anteriorly, if you're like, pull it outwards?\n\nP: Um no.\n\nD: And how about if you pull the tibia posteriorly, any instability?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, um and the is their full range of motion of the knee?\n\nP: Yes.\n\nD: And full range of motion of the hip and ankle?\n\nP: Yes. \n\nD: OK, um and do you have any like numbness, tingling or muscle weakness? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and any sensory changes to the skin?\n\nP: No, no.\n\nD: OK and reflexes are normal. \n\nP: Mmmm\n\nD: OK. So I think that was everything I wanted to ask and and kind of go through on the physical exam. Did you have any other questions or anything that maybe I forgot to mention today?\n\nP: Ah no, that was it. Just what can I do about my my knee?\n\nD: Yeah, so right now it's sounding like this could be an MCL or medial collateral ligament strain, or injury and so these types of injuries are usually treated conservatively, like with things like NSAIDs or anti-inflammatories to help that pain and swelling. If the pain depending on how severe it is, it might be useful to use maybe crutches for a day or two to try to help let the pain to subside and allow you to be able to do some physical therapy exercises like strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. \n\nP: OK.\n\nD: But typically injuries that are lower grade will heal within two weeks and so if it's more more severe, it could take a bit longer. And although that it's most likely an MCL injury that you're describing, it could be a medial meniscal injury as well or possibly even a bursitis at the medial aspect of the knee. But the treatment to start with would be the same and maybe we will get any x-ray if things aren't improving.\n\nP: OK, that sounds good, thank you.\n\n",

and can you tell me a little bit about your living situation like you you are living with and whereabouts sure i live with both my parents and 3 of my siblings ok and are you going to school i am i am in my last year of grade 12 ok well that is good how is that been going it has been going ok we have been doing part online part in person ok have you been around anybody who has been sick no alright then and you play soccer do you play any other sports and i play football ok cool and any injuries before to your knee or anything like that not that in the past alright and do you smoke cigarettes no do you drink alcohol no ok did you use any recreational drugs like marijuana or anything else no ok are you currently sexually active i am ok are you in a relationship i am we have been together for a year ok is there any concern for a sexually transmitted infection no we were both tested ok great and any chance that you could be pregnant no ok and in the family are there any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions no ok and so that i that was everything i wanted to ask on history so for the physical exam when inspecting the knee are you seeing any joint effusions or joint swelling or ecchymosis or bruising it looks or is that a bruise it looks red and i would say it is a little bit swollen on the medial aspect only ok is there any muscle atrophy no ok and is there any misalignment or joint deformities no not that i notice ok and alright on gait or walking is there any limp or antalgia no you are able to walk normally i am able to walk normally and it hurts but i think i am walking ok ok uhm and next is there any changes to temperature like the joint itself feel hot no ok and are there any areas of the joint line itself of the knee that is painful to palpation at just the medial part of it like the i guess where the ligament would be ok so just let me ok and any pain over the patella no any pain over the tibial tuberosity or patellar tendon no any pain over your over the fibular head or the lateral part of the knee no any pain in the calf or the thigh muscles no any pain in the hamstring muscles no ok and is there any pain to a like varus stress of the knee to the varus stress i guess it would be there will be pain if i press down in that area ok and is there any joint yeah the joint laxity or pain too like a valgus stress of the knee yeah so when i press when i do that it hurts on the medial aspect but not the lateral aspect ok uhm and does it feel is as though there is some like the joints opening more when you put the valgus stress a little bit yes ok uhm and is there any instability moving the tibia anteriorly if you are like pull it outwards no and how about if you pull the tibia posteriorly any instability no ok and the is their full range of motion of the knee yes and full range of motion of the hip and ankle yes ok and do you have any like numbness tingling or muscle weakness no ok and any sensory changes to the skin no no ok and reflexes are normal mmmm ok so i think that was everything i wanted to ask and and kind of go through on the physical exam did you have any other questions or anything that maybe i forgot to mention today ah no that was it just what can i do about my my knee yeah so right now it is sounding like this could be an mcl or medial collateral ligament strain or injury and so these types of injuries are usually treated conservatively like with things like nsaids or anti inflammatories to help that pain and swelling if the pain depending on how severe it is it might be useful to use maybe crutches for a day or 2 to try to help let the pain to subside and allow you to be able to do some physical therapy exercises like strengthening the quadriceps and hamstring muscles ok but typically injuries that are lower grade will heal within 2 weeks and so if it is more more severe it could take a bit longer and although that it is most likely an mcl injury that you are describing it could be a medial meniscal injury as well or possibly even a bursitis at the medial aspect of the knee but the treatment to start with would be the same and maybe we will get any x ray if things are not improving ok that sounds good thank you",
