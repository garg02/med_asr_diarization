I'm hoping to cut down.\n\nD: OK, that's good, and if at any point you need help or I would like to discuss that, just please let me know. OK, and do you smoke cigarettes?\n\nP: I do. \n\nD: OK, how much do you smoke?\n\nP: Talk about half a pack a day.\n\nD: And for how long have you been smoking for?\n\nP: For the past almost 20 years.\n\nD: OK, have you thought about cutting down?\n\nP: Ah yeah again, that's something that I'm hoping to quit doing in the future as well.\n\nD: Certainly OK. And are you currently sexually active?\n\nP: I am.\n\nD: OK and. Could you tell me about your partners or partner?\n\nP: Yeah, just my wife. We've been together for the past five years.\n\nD: OK, any concerns for a sexually transmitted infection at this time? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK. And any a musculoskeletal or neurological conditions that run in the family?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and how about any cancers that run in the family?\n\nP: No cancers that I know of.\n\nD: OK, and how about heart conditions or or lung conditions?\n\nP: No, nothing like that. \n\nD: OK, so next. Just wanted to move on to their physical exam piece of the appointment today, so just looking at your um, the, at your feet and at the joints of the ankle and toes are you seeing any swelling, redness, or yeah, any swelling or redness?\n\nP: Um no no swelling or redness.\n\nD: All right, are there is there a temperature change to your feet or any of the joints? Are they feeling hot or cold? \n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. And is there any deformities or misalignment of any of the joints? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and any scarring from any of the trauma?\n\nP: Uhm, there are like. Yeah, there's some scarring from like ulcers.\n\nD: From previous ones that have that have healed? \n\nP: Healed. Yeah, that's right.\n\nD: OK, and. And is there any pain to palpation over the um ankle joint, over the ankle joint?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, then how about over any of the joints of your toes?\n\nP: Um no not nothing like that. No pain, just um I can't feel it.\n\nD: OK. And how is the range of motion of your feet and toes?\n\nP: Um pretty good. I can move them all.\n\nD: OK, and then how about your knees?\n\nP: My knees are also the same.\n\nD: OK, uh, an any ankle like instability with any special tests?\n\nP: No\n\nD: OK, and and on walking is there any limp or does it appear, how does the walk appear?\n\nP: I'm pretty normal. I'm not limping.\n\nD: OK. And. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask and and check today. Did you have any questions?\n\nP: Just what do you think is going on with my feet and how do I get some sensation back?\n\nD: So it does sound like it could be related to diabetes where what happens is you get like a peripheral neuropathy overtime and you can lose sensation to your feet in a glove and stocking distribution, which sounds like the history history you're saying today with having sensation reduced on your feet and also your fingertips as well. \n\nP: Mmmm\n\nD: Where you lose sensation and you can't feel pain. And so But other things to consider could be. Possibly like vitamin deficiencies or things like that, but I would be much much lower down on the differential. And. So to regain sensation I think. Really, the only thing that can be done now is to help prevent further damage to the nerves, and that would be to make sure that the diabetes is under good control and. Trying to monitor your feet as regularly as you can, making sure that the. There aren't any kind of open wounds or sores that are are not healing. If things are not healing, it will be important to check to see if there is an underlying infection such as osteomyelitis, which will prevent wound healing. And so if there are any, is anything like that it would be important to have that checked out. So feet hygiene is extremely important. As we're working on improving the diabetes control as well as things like cutting down alcohol could could also help as well.\n\nP: OK OK, thank you.\n",

and are you working currently okay and have you been around anybody who has been sick okay and have you traveled anywhere recently alright and do you drink alcohol okay how many drinks per day would you have and how many drinks per week okay do you feel as though that is a lot okay that is good and if at any point you need help or would like to discuss that just please let me know okay and do you smoke cigarettes okay how much do you smoke and for how long have you been smoking for okay have you thought about cutting down certainly okay and are you currently sexually active okay and can you tell me about your partners or partner okay any concerns for a sexually transmitted infection at this time okay and any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions that run in the family okay and how about any cancers that run in the family okay and how about heart conditions or lung conditions okay so next i just wanted to move on to the physical exam piece of the appointment today okay so just looking at your feet and the joints of the ankle and toes are you seeing any swelling redness is there a temperature change to your feet or any of the joints are they feeling hot or cold okay and is there any deformities or misalignment of any of the joints okay and any scarring from any of the trauma from previous ones that have healed okay and is there any pain to palpation over the ankle joint okay and then how about over any of the joints of your toes okay and how is the range of motion of your feet and toes okay and then how about your knees okay and any ankle instability with any special tests okay and on walking is there any limp or does it appear how does the walk appear okay so that was everything that i wanted to ask and check today did you have any questions so it does sound like it could be related to diabetes where what happens is you get a peripheral neuropathy over time and you can lose sensation to your feet and glove and stocking distribution which sounds like the history you are saying today with having sensation reduced on your feet and also your fingertips as well where you lose sensation and you can not feel pain but other things to consider could be possibly like vitamin deficiencies or things like that but that would be much much lower down on the differential and so to regain sensation i think really the only thing that can be done now is to help prevent further damage to the nerves and that would be to make sure that the diabetes is under good control and trying to monitor your feet as regularly as you can making sure that there are not any kind of open wounds or sores that are not healing if things are not healing it will be important to check to see if there is an underlying infection such as osteomyelitis which will prevent wound healing and so if there is anything like that it would be important to have that checked out so feet hygiene is extremely important as we are working on improving that diabetes control as well as things like cutting down alcohol could also help as well okay thank you",
