Other than that, no symptoms.\n\nD: I see, and have you tried anything to make, make the symptoms better?\n\nP: Um, I've tried some Tylenol, I've tried some, um like, cough suppressants, but nothing seems to be helping.\n\nD: Okay, um, and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?\n\nP: Um, no, not um, well actually, I have, I had, I have osteoporosis, for which I'm taking calcium and vitamin D, as well as like um, alendronate, alendronate, some sort of bisphosphonate.\n\nD: Okay, have you had any, uh, like bone fractures?\n\nP: Um, I had um, a hip fracture, like uh, two years ago.\n\nD: Okay and um, and how is the recovery and mobility been?\n\nP: Um, pretty good now.\n\nD: Oh, that's great.

Is this, or how many drinks per week would you say?\n\nP: Um, per week, maybe like three.\n\nD: Okay, um, and any uh, heart or lung conditions that run in the family?\n\nP: Um, yeah so, there is um, like lung cancer, there's asthma, there's uh, COPD. All of that, someone, like my, both sides of my family had.\n\nD: Okay, and uh, anybody in the family have like a bleeding disorder?\n\nP: A bleeding disorder, no.\n\nD: Okay, anybody else in the family have either a deep vein thrombosis or, or PE?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Alright, um, and have you been around any, anybody who's been sick?\n\nP: No, not recently.\n\nD: Alright, and have you traveled anywhere outside of the city, or?\n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: Okay, um, so that was everything I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything that uh, that you wanted to add?\n\nP: No, those are all questions that I had. Um, do you think um, I need to be hospitalized, um, because I'm very short of breath, or do you think I can just um, stay at home? Do you think I need antibiotics?\n\nD: Yeah, so we'll, we'll check your temperature and, and confirm the fever and um, check your oxygen levels as well. You might need oxygen, um, you're mentioning, with your shortness of breath. Um, and we will get a chest x-ray, and if um, we're seeing consolidation there, suggestive of pneumonia, you may need antibiotics that will cover, cover those, those bugs. However, your symptoms do overlap with COVID as well, and so it will be important to get a, um, COVID swab. But to answer if you will need a hospital stay, I think we'll need to at least wait until some of the investigations come back and, um, that will help determine how severe the symptoms are and we'll observe you over the next few hours, and if you are getting any worse or um, anything like that, then it might be a good idea, um, to uh, to be admitted.\n\nP: Okay. Okay yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.\n\nD: You're welcome.",
