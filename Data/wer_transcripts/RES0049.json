    "ref": "D: What brings you in?\n\nP: Yeah, nice to meet you I, I've been having just over the last week my cough that's been getting worse and I had a fever a couple of nights and just yesterday I noticed that I started having a loss of taste and smell so that got me really worried.\n\nD: OK, so yeah, let's rewind a little bit. The cough you said started a couple of weeks ago, so would that be about 2 weeks? Three weeks? \n\nP: I would say last week, so like 7 seven days ago.\n\nD: Seven days ago, OK. So that started seven days ago and then when did the fever start?\n\nP: The fever I hasn't been constant, but I've like had some nights where I just feel really chilly and then during the day sometimes even getting these chills I've been recorded at a temperature, but I think I've had a fever at least three times in the last week.\n\nD: OK, so you haven't actually taken your temperature, but it you just feel like you have chills?\n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: OK, we could take your temperature today. And then the loss of smell and taste. Do they both happen at the same time?\n\nP: I think the taste happened like before, but that was just yesterday and then yesterday morning like at breakfast, I couldn't really taste anything and then continued during lunch and dinner, but smell, I kind of lost around the evening. \n\nD: OK.\n\nP: Yeah, all just started yesterday.\n\nD: OK. Um alright, so let's go back to the cough and has it been constant since it started?\n\nP: Yeah, it's been pretty constant. It's been getting worse, especially like in the last few days. I'm mainly coughing like before I was coughing mainly at night, but now I'm coughing throughout the day.\n\nD: OK, um so yeah, you mentioned possibly a trigger would be like time of day at night? Or did you notice any other triggers like you know, the cold air or dust or anything at home that could be potentially triggering your cough?\n\nP: Uh no, not really. Like I've lived in the same place for awhile, no new changes and I've been barely going outside, so I don't think there are any triggers.\n\nD: OK, and in terms of the quality of your cough is that, would you say it's harsh? Barky?\n\nP: Uhm, I would just say it's like kind of harsh at times, but mainly it's a dry cough, like I'm not bringing anything up.\n\nD: OK, OK. And then you said dry cough so no sputum or blood right?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. Have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?\n\nP: Not the loss of taste and smell, but like the other stuff when I just had a cold or flu like symptoms previously, but the taste and smell is something completely new.\n\nD: OK. And then, um, have you experienced any shortness of breath?\n\nP: Um, not really, no.\n\nD: No, OK. How about we wheeziness?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Chest pain?\n\nP: No chest pain.\n\nD: OK. Uh, experienced any weight loss recently?\n\nP: No, not that I know.\n\nD: OK, how about fatigue?\n\nP: I have been a bit tired in the last few days. The fevers at night and morning. Just feeling a little bit crummy, just not really energetic, energetic to do anything.\n\nD: Yeah, for sure. \n\nP: Just been planner, just sitting on the couch.\n\nD: OK. Any changes to your hair, nails, or skin, like rashes?\n\nP: No, I haven't noticed anything like that. \n\nD: OK, you mentioned loss of smell. Do you have a runny nose or a stuffy nose?\n\nP: I did have a runny nose earlier this week, but that's kind of subsided. Other than that, I don't really feel too much congestion. I've been taking Tylenol, the Tylenol cold so I don't know if that helped.\n\nD: OK, how often are you taking the Tylenol cold?\n\nP: I just took it like for four days just before going to sleep in the last week.\n\nD: Oh, I see. OK. OK and then. Any I do have a sore throat?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, ok. How about any changes to your vision or hearing?\n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: Any pain or discharge in the eyes or ears?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK. Do you ever feel like your heart's racing?\n\nP: Uh no, not really.\n\nD: No, OK. And any swelling in your limbs?\n\nP: Uh, no, I don't think so.\n\nD: OK, any dizziness or fainting spells?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK. Confusion or memory loss?\n\nP: No, not that I can tell.\n\nD: OK, any changes in your bowel habits like constant constipation or diarrhea.\n\nP: Oh no, not really.\n\nD: No, no blood in the stool, right?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, any changes to your appetite?\n\nP: Um, just maybe in like a little bit with the loss of smell and taste, the food is not really the same in the last day, last few days?\n\nD: Yeah yeah, that makes sense. Any nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: No, OK. And any changes in terms of urine?\n\nP: No, I've been peeing alright.\n\nD: OK, good. Any major or a longstanding medical conditions, or are you otherwise healthy?\n\nP: No, I've been fortunate otherwise healthy. I had asthma as a kid, but like I haven't had to use the puffers for more than a decade.\n\nD: Oh ok. OK. And what triggers your asthma?\n\nP: I think back then it was just when I did sports and I was running around a lot. I've been fine for the last 10 years at least. \n\nD: OK. OK, that's good. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, OK. Any are you on any medications?\n\nP: Currently just the other thing, Tylenol cold, but other than that no other medications.\n\nD: OK, not even other over the counter medications or herbal supplements?\n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK. Do you have any allergies?\n\nP: Um, sometimes in the fall like I get a bit sniffly and, but other than that, I don't know of any allergies to any foods or medications.\n\nD: OK. And how about immunizations? Are you up to date?\n\nP: Yeah, they're all up to date.\n\nD: Any lung conditions or heart conditions that run in the family?\n\nP: Uh, my father did recently have a heart attack at age of 58 I think he was, he, he's fine though, but that's that's about it.\n\nD: OK, um any cancers that run in the family?\n\nP: Um, no, I don't think so.\n\nD: OK. And, and do you smoke?\n\nP: Uh, yeah, yeah I do.\n\nD: OK, how much do you smoke?\n\nP: Probably, I would say a pack a day.\n\nD: Pack a day, OK. For how long?\n\nP: Ah, probably since in my 20s, so at least 10 years now.\n\nD: OK, have you ever thought about cutting down?\n\nP: Yeah, especially with this pandemic going on, it's been, I've been trying to cut down just because like I don't want to get the, get COVID and then you know my lungs are probably already weaker because of the smoking. So I've been trying to cut down.\n\nD: Yeah, for sure it's good that you're trying to cut down. We have resources to help you if you ever need them. \n\nP: Yeah, for sure. \n\nD: Do you do marijuana?\n\nP: No, no, I've never tried marijuana.\n\nD: OK, how about other recreational drugs?\n\nP: No, um, besides alcohol, nothing else.\n\nD: OK, and then um, I guess I'll ask you about the alcohol, uhm, how much do you drink?\n\nP: Um, um, not that much. I'd probably say like a few times a week when there's a game on. I just grab a couple of beers, but that's about it. \n\nD: OK. Uhm, and where do you live right now?\n\nP: Yes, I just live just outside of London with my wife and daughter in a small townhouse.\n\nD: OK and anyone else at home sick?\n\nP: No. I I've kind of stayed away once I noticed some symptoms. I'm just kind of just staying in my room, not getting out. I don't wanna make any of my families like.\n\nD: Yeah, that makes sense. And have you traveled to anywhere recently?\n\nP: No, umm, I haven't really traveled. I do I do go to work though I haven't in the last last week. I've told them that I've been having these symptoms, but other than that, no traveling.\n\nD: OK. Uhm, OK, that's good. Those were all the questions I had for you today. Was there anything that you wanted to ask me or anything else that you wanted to discuss that I may have missed?\n\nP: Uh, yeah, I I that I'm just wondering like I could it be COVID I I don't know. I don't know if someone in the office had it or yeah, it was just basically worried about, if I had COVID.\n\nD: Yeah for sure. that's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we will be doing a COVID swab on you and and you will hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with the results. But regardless, because your symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID especially umm, the loss of smell and taste, we do recommend that you isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from family members as well. So we'll, that's where we'll start. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. But, we'll start with, we'll start with these COVID swabs. How does that sound?\n\nP: Yeah, that sounds good. I'll, I'll let my work know and yeah, hopefully it comes back negative, but I'll stay away from everyone till then. \n\nD: OK, sounds great, thank you.\n\nP: Alright, thank you so much.\n",

    "pred_norm_p": "yeah nice to meet you i have been having just over the last week a cough that has been getting worse and i had a fever a couple nights and just yesterday i noticed that i started having loss of taste and smell so that got me really worried i would say last week so like 7 days ago the fever has not been constant but i have had some nights where i just feel really chilly and then during the day sometimes i am getting these chills i have not recorded a temperature but i think i have had a fever at least 3 times in the last week yeah i think the taste happened before but that was just yesterday and then yesterday morning at breakfast i could not really taste anything and then continued during lunch and dinner but smell i kind of lost around the evening okay yeah it has been pretty constant it has been getting worse especially in the last few days i am mainly coughing before i was coughing mainly at night but now i am coughing throughout the day no not really i have lived in the same place for a while no new changes and i have been barely going outside so i do not think there are any triggers i would just say it is kind of harsh at times but mainly it is a dry cough like i am not bringing anything up no not the loss of taste and smell but the other stuff when i just had a cold or flu like symptoms previously but the taste and smell is something completely new not really no no no chest pain no not that i know of i have been a bit tired in the last few days so with the fevers at night and the morning just feeling a little bit crummy just not really energetic to do anything just been kind of just sitting on the couch no i have not noticed anything like that i did have a runny nose earlier this week but that is kind of subsided other than that i do not really feel too much congestion i have been taking tylenol the tylenol cold so i do not know if that helped i just took it like for 4 days just before going to sleep in the last week no no nothing like that no no not really no no no not that i can tell no not really no just maybe like a little bit with the loss of smell and taste it is not really the same in the last few days no no i have been peeing all right no i have been fortunate otherwise healthy i had asthma as a kid but like i have not had to use the puffers for more than a decade i think back then it was just when i did sports and i was running around a lot i have been fine for the last 10 years at least no currently just the i was taking tylenol cold but other than that no other medications no nothing like that sometimes in the fall like i get a bit sniffly but other than that i do not know if any allergies to any foods or medications yeah they are all up to date my father did recently have a heart attack at the age of 58 i think he was he is fine though but that is about it no i do not think so yeah yeah i do probably i would say a pack a day and probably since my 20s so at least 10 years now yeah especially with this pandemic going on i have been trying to cut down just because i do not want to get the get covid and then you know my lungs are probably already weaker because of the smoking so i have been trying to cut down yeah for sure no no i have never tried marijuana no besides alcohol nothing else not that much i would probably say like a few times a week when there is a game on i just grab a couple of beers but that is about it yeah so i just live just outside of london with my wife and daughter in a small townhouse no i have kind of stayed away once i noticed some symptoms i am just kind of staying in my room not getting out i do not want to make any of my family sick no i have not really traveled i do go to work though i have not in the last week i have told them that i have been having these symptoms but other than that no traveling yeah i am just wondering could it be covid i do not know if someone in the office had it or i was just basically worried about if i had covid yeah that sounds good i will let my work know and yeah hopefully it comes back negative but i will stay away from everyone until then all right thank you so much",
    "ref_norm": "what brings you in yeah nice to meet you i i have been having just over the last week my cough that has been getting worse and i had a fever a couple of nights and just yesterday i noticed that i started having a loss of taste and smell so that got me really worried ok so yeah let us rewind a little bit the cough you said started a couple of weeks ago so would that be about 2 weeks 3 weeks i would say last week so like 77 days ago 7 days ago ok so that started 7 days ago and then when did the fever start the fever i has not been constant but i have like had some nights where i just feel really chilly and then during the day sometimes even getting these chills i have been recorded at a temperature but i think i have had a fever at least 3 times in the last week ok so you have not actually taken your temperature but it you just feel like you have chills yeah ok we could take your temperature today and then the loss of smell and taste do they both happen at the same time i think the taste happened like before but that was just yesterday and then yesterday morning like at breakfast i could not really taste anything and then continued during lunch and dinner but smell i kind of lost around the evening ok yeah all just started yesterday ok alright so let us go back to the cough and has it been constant since it started yeah it has been pretty constant it has been getting worse especially like in the last few days i am mainly coughing like before i was coughing mainly at night but now i am coughing throughout the day ok so yeah you mentioned possibly a trigger would be like time of day at night or did you notice any other triggers like you know the cold air or dust or anything at home that could be potentially triggering your cough no not really like i have lived in the same place for awhile no new changes and i have been barely going outside so i do not think there are any triggers ok and in terms of the quality of your cough is that would you say it is harsh barky uhm i would just say it is like kind of harsh at times but mainly it is a dry cough like i am not bringing anything up ok ok and then you said dry cough so no sputum or blood right no ok have you ever experienced anything like this in the past not the loss of taste and smell but like the other stuff when i just had a cold or flu like symptoms previously but the taste and smell is something completely new ok and then have you experienced any shortness of breath not really no no ok how about we wheeziness no chest pain no chest pain ok experienced any weight loss recently no not that i know ok how about fatigue i have been a bit tired in the last few days the fevers at night and morning just feeling a little bit crummy just not really energetic energetic to do anything yeah for sure just been planner just sitting on the couch ok any changes to your hair nails or skin like rashes no i have not noticed anything like that ok you mentioned loss of smell do you have a runny nose or a stuffy nose i did have a runny nose earlier this week but that is kind of subsided other than that i do not really feel too much congestion i have been taking tylenol the tylenol cold so i do not know if that helped ok how often are you taking the tylenol cold i just took it like for 4 days just before going to sleep in the last week 0 i see ok ok and then any i do have a sore throat no no ok how about any changes to your vision or hearing no nothing like that any pain or discharge in the eyes or ears no ok do you ever feel like your heart is racing no not really no ok and any swelling in your limbs no i do not think so ok any dizziness or fainting spells no ok confusion or memory loss no not that i can tell ok any changes in your bowel habits like constant constipation or diarrhea 0 no not really no no blood in the stool right no ok any changes to your appetite just maybe in like a little bit with the loss of smell and taste the food is not really the same in the last day last few days yeah yeah that makes sense any nausea or vomiting no no ok and any changes in terms of urine no i have been peeing alright ok good any major or a longstanding medical conditions or are you otherwise healthy no i have been fortunate otherwise healthy i had asthma as a kid but like i have not had to use the puffers for more than a decade 0 ok ok and what triggers your asthma i think back then it was just when i did sports and i was running around a lot i have been fine for the last 10 years at least ok ok that is good and any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past no no ok any are you on any medications currently just the other thing tylenol cold but other than that no other medications ok not even other over the counter medications or herbal supplements no nothing like that ok do you have any allergies sometimes in the fall like i get a bit sniffly and but other than that i do not know of any allergies to any foods or medications ok and how about immunizations are you up to date yeah they are all up to date any lung conditions or heart conditions that run in the family my father did recently have a heart attack at age of 58 i think he was he he is fine though but that is that is about it ok any cancers that run in the family no i do not think so ok and and do you smoke yeah yeah i do ok how much do you smoke probably i would say a pack a day pack a day ok for how long ah probably since in my 20s so at least 10 years now ok have you ever thought about cutting down yeah especially with this pandemic going on it has been i have been trying to cut down just because like i do not want to get the get covid and then you know my lungs are probably already weaker because of the smoking so i have been trying to cut down yeah for sure it is good that you are trying to cut down we have resources to help you if you ever need them yeah for sure do you do marijuana no no i have never tried marijuana ok how about other recreational drugs no besides alcohol nothing else ok and then i guess i will ask you about the alcohol uhm how much do you drink not that much i would probably say like a few times a week when there is a game on i just grab a couple of beers but that is about it ok uhm and where do you live right now yes i just live just outside of london with my wife and daughter in a small townhouse ok and anyone else at home sick no i i have kind of stayed away once i noticed some symptoms i am just kind of just staying in my room not getting out i do not want to make any of my families like yeah that makes sense and have you traveled to anywhere recently no umm i have not really traveled i do i do go to work though i have not in the last last week i have told them that i have been having these symptoms but other than that no traveling ok uhm ok that is good those were all the questions i had for you today was there anything that you wanted to ask me or anything else that you wanted to discuss that i may have missed yeah i i that i am just wondering like i could it be covid i i do not know i do not know if someone in the office had it or yeah it was just basically worried about if i had covid yeah for sure that is definitely something that we need to rule out so we will be doing a covid swab on you and and you will hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with the results but regardless because your symptoms overlap with symptoms of covid especially umm the loss of smell and taste we do recommend that you isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from family members as well so we will that is where we will start if it is not covid it could be another viral illness that is going around at this time of year but we will start with we will start with these covid swabs how does that sound yeah that sounds good i will i will let my work know and yeah hopefully it comes back negative but i will stay away from everyone till then ok sounds great thank you alright thank you so much",
