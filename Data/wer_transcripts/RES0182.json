They just happen throughout the day.\n\nD: OK, and have you tried anything for the cough?\n\nP: I tried this cough suppressants. I tried like salt water rinses, like just like at home remedies and over the counter products, but nothing is helping. \n\nD: OK.

Yeah, that's been happening. \n\nD: Any particular muscles? Or is it more general?\n\nP: It's more general.\n\nD: Have, have you been having any bone pain like any in your back or anything like that?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and, uh, how has your energy been?\n\nP: Ah, pretty low.\n\nD: OK, and how is your appetite been?\n\nP: Uhm, also pretty low.\n\nD: OK. And in the in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?\n\nP: Uhm, no, I've been pretty healthy so far.\n\nD: OK. Uhm, so do you take any medications regularly for anything?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. And do you have any allergies to medications or, or anything environmental?\n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any prior hospitalizations or surgeries?\n\nP: Uhm, no. \n\nD: OK. And, uh, could you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently? Like who you're living with an ah, whereabouts you're living?\n\nP: Uhm, I live alone by myself. I live in an apartment downtown.\n\nD: OK, and are you working currently or in school or?\n\nP: Um, I'm working from home right now. \n\nD: OK, have you been around anybody who's been sick?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Have you traveled anywhere recently?\n\nP: No, not since I moved here.\n\nD: OK, when did you move here and where did you move from?\n\nP: I moved here a year back from Sri Lanka.\n\nD: OK. And, and in Sri Lanka, were any of your family members or people that you spent time around ever diagnosed with tuberculosis?\n\nP: I mean, it's pretty common in Sri Lanka. None of my immediate family members were.\n\nD: OK. And do you smoke cigarettes? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: And ah, do you smoke cannabis or use any cannabis products?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK.

Did you have any other questions for me today? I think that was everything I wanted to ask about for now. \n\nP: Ah no, what do you like, what do you think I have, and how do you think I should treat it?\n\nD: So, uh, yeah, it's sounding like, like it could be tuberculosis based on the kind of timeline of your symptoms and so and cough and hemoptysis and so we'll do a test for that, like an acid fast test of the sputum. Get a chest X Ray. And if it is tuberculosis, it will require a prolonged course of antibiotics, so that I'll be over several months. Umm, and so I we'll get the infectious disease team involved to help kind of guide our management with the appropriate antibiotic choice, if it does come back to be tuberculosis.\n\nP: OK. OK, that sounds good, thank you.\n\n",
