OK, so you're worried you might be having a heart attack as well? \n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: OK, so we can definitely do some tests and see what was going on. I just have a few more questions and then I'll just get to some of the management and what we will be doing for you in the future. So currently right now do you work at all?\n\nP: No, I'm a student.
