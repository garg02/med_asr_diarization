We'll do a Covid swab on you um just to rule that in or out, you should hear back for, about those results, in 24 to 48 hours. While you're here in the hospital, we're also going to do a chest X-Ray and or like an AFB smear to see if you have active TB or latent TB. If those come back positive um we will require you to isolate because this uh, because TB is highly infectious and it's airborne. Um so we have a couple of uh, we have like a regimen that we'd put you on. It's called the RIPE medications that we keep you on for two months and then we continue a couple of those for another four months. Um but we will uh keep you here until we have more answers on um like from this TB standpoint. How does that sound?\n\nP: Yeah, that sounds good. Um yeah I'm really worried, but hopefully it's not TB.\n\nD: Yeah, hopefully it's not, um but if it is, it's it's OK, like um we'll get infectious disease involved.
