Anything that makes it better?\n\nP: Yeah, I took a Tylenol, I took um, Advil. It helps for like a few hours and then it just comes back.\n\nD: And anything that makes the pain worse?\n\nP: Um, I definitely think just, if I rest, it's better if, but if I'm like, like I can't, I can't concentrate on work or like anything.\n\nD: Okay.

Are you tolerating it okay?\n\nP: Yeah I've, I've been tolerating it well. It's just they, they said like I'm kind of just on the edge of the diabetes, like my level, so they just want to act, um, proactively.\n\nD: Yeah, that's good. Um, any other medical conditions?\n\nP: No, that's, that's all.\n\nD: Any medications other than metformin that you take? Anything over the counter?\n\nP: Um, so I do take, when my migraines get bad, like I do take, I have taken naproxen before. \n\nD: Okay.

Um, and any um, family history of any medical conditions?\n\nP: Uh, so on my dad's side, they like all, like all the men seem to have diabetes, so it's good that I'm starting on the medication. Um on my mom's side, they're pretty healthy. I don't think my mom has any medical conditions.\n\nD: Okay, good. Um, and do you currently live alone or do you live with other people?\n\nP: Yeah, so I live with my wife, I live with my two kids, a son and daughter.\n\nD: And um, have you or any of them had any exposures to anyone who could possibly be sick?\n\nP: Um just, uh, so my wife is a school teacher, um, and they did have in-person. Just uh, she's a high school teacher, and they had some they have in-person classes. So yeah, I don't know, but she's been feeling well. My kids are feeling well too.\n\nD: Okay, and have you traveled anywhere outside the province?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Okay, and do you currently smoke or did you ever smoke in the past?\n\nP: No, I've never smoked. I do smoke marijuana just, maybe once or twice a month with some friends.\n\nD: Okay, any recreational drugs? \n\nP: Sorry, no. \n\nD: Um, any alcohol?\n\nP: Yeah, I probably drink um, a couple of beers during the weekend.\n\nD: Okay, got it. Um, alright. Well, given your symptoms, um, we would like to do a COVID swab, just in, or request a COVID swab to be done through public health, um, just to, just to rule it out. Your symptoms do sound like, or overlap with some of the symptoms that are seen in patients who do have COVID. It could be that you have um, just um, just I guess like your headache and fever. Um, I'll also like do a physical exam to see there's nothing else going on. But in the meantime, I, I'd like you to self isolate and stay away from the rest of your family members as well, um, at least until the results are out. And then when the results are out, if it's positive, you'll receive more guidelines from public health as to what you need to do.\n\nP: Okay, sounds good, um, and I work from home, so I don't need to.\n\nD: Oh that's good.
