    "ref": "D: What can I do for you?\n\nP: So I've been, just over the last week, I've been feeling pretty sick. I have this pretty bad headache that started like probably a week ago, and then for the last few days I've been having these chills. Um, and I didn't get a chance to measure my temperature at all, um, but the worst thing has been just these muscle aches all over my body, and that's been going on for the last three to four days.\n\nD: Sorry to hear that you're feeling so, uh, horrible over the past week. Um let's uh, let's try to understand this a little bit better. So you've had this headache for the past week or so. Where exactly is it?\n\nP: It's kind of just uh, all across my forehead. It's been going to the sides, like into my temples as well.\n\nD: Okay, and what does it feel like? How would you describe it?\n\nP: Uh yeah, it feels like, kind of like uh aching um, I, I have had headaches with throbbing before, but it's not so much throbbing it's more just constant, aching pain.\n\nD: Um, if you had to give it a number from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst um, pain ever, what number would you give it?\n\nP: Uh, probably like a 7.\n\nD: Oh wow, yeah, that sounds severe. How long have you, how long has it been a 7 for?\n\nP: Um, it's actually a bit better now, but yeah, like over the last week it's been a 7. I would say now, it's probably around 5. \n\nD: Okay. Um, anything that makes the headache better?\n\nP: Um I, I take like Tylenol, then like, it gets relieved for a bit, for like a few hours, and then comes back.\n\nD: Anything that you feel makes the headaches worse? Any postures, or positions, or activity or um, any kind of exposure to light or sounds?\n\nP: Uh no it's, it's just kind of there. Nothing makes it worse.\n\nD: Do you have nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: Uh no, no nausea or vomiting.\n\nD: No. Any sensitivity to light or sounds?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Okay. Uh, and is it only, is it only on one, on one side of your head or forehead, or is it on both sides?\n\nP: Uh it, it seems like it's on both sides.\n\nD: And have you noticed any visual changes? Any blurry vision with the headaches?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Any other visual changes? No, okay. Um, and you've also had chills, but you said you haven't checked your temperature, right? \n\nP: No, I haven't, uh, I've been having chills for the last few nights.\n\nD: Yeah, we can definitely check your temperature here in the, um here. Um, and you mentioned that the muscle aches have been quite bothersome for you. Is it all over your body or anyone, uh, in any one muscle group?\n\nP: It seems like it's all over. \n\nD: Okay, okay. And um, I'll ask you about a couple other symptoms just to rule out um, any other issues that you might be having. So have you noticed that you've been confused at all over the past few days?\n\nP: Uh no, I don't think so.\n\nD: Have you had any like stiffness or rigidity in your neck?\n\nP: Maybe a little bit of a stiffness in, in my neck.\n\nD: Okay. \n\nP: Then like I, I don't know if that's just the muscle pain. It's like kind of on my upper back, lower neck area.\n\nD: We can definitely um, examine that, um, when I'm doing physical examine and see how that is. Um, okay, and uh, have you had any, um, redness in your eyes, or any teary eyes?\n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: Do the headaches come and go, or is it always there?\n\nP: Uh, they're pretty much like constant throughout the day.\n\nD: Um, and do you have a runny nose or stuffy nose?\n\nP: Uh no, no I don't I, I think I'm kind of, I'm developing a little cough though.\n\nD: Okay, when did that start? \n\nP: Probably just yesterday I noticed myself coughing.\n\nD: Is it like a dry cough or wet cough?\n\nP: Uh, a dry cough.\n\nD: Any sputum or any blood come out?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any sore throat?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Uh, any chest pain?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any difficulties with breathing?\n\nP: Uh, no. \n\nD: Any palpitations, or feel like your heart's beating very fast?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Okay, any belly pain? \n\nP: No. \n\nD: Any uh, nausea or vomiting? \n\nP: Nope.\n\nD: Any uh, diarrhea or constipation?\n\nP: No, not that I've noticed.\n\nD: Any weakness in any one side of your body?\n\nP: Nope. \n\nD: Any numbness or tingling?\n\nP: Nope.\n\nD: No, okay. Um, any exposures uh, to anyone who could be sick?\n\nP: Um, I haven't noticed, but I, I do go to work, um, and we recently switched to like in person instead of I, I used to do um, home work, but for the last month I've been going into the office.\n\nD: I see, and have you been wearing a mask?\n\nP: Yeah, well I try to wear the mask. Sometimes like uh, in the, in the stock, like lounge, we like take take off the mask to eat and stuff but that's about it.\n\nD: Are you maintaining social distancing when you're taking your mask off?\n\nP: Yeah, it's uh, most of the times we're pretty socially distanced when we're eating, but sometimes it's like hard to control when you know, when you're going near the microwave to heat up your food, and sometimes it gets hard. It's a, it's a fairly small room, so.\n\nD: Yeah, well I would, I would recommend that you try to eat when people are not in the room if possible because you are putting yourself at risk.  Like if it's a small room, I think you should also talk to management or try to limit the number of people who can be in the room at a time. Um, for your own safety, you know, and for the safety of others uh, working with you. Um okay, and um, have you traveled anywhere recently?\n\nP: No, we've been uh, at home. \n\nD: Okay, good, um, and who do you live with?\n\nP: I live with my young, like uh, daughter and then my wife as well.\n\nD: Okay, and you, do you think they might have got any contacts to anyone who is sick?\n\nP: Uh no, they've been completely fine. Uh, my daughter is like, is uh, doing school from home right now, so she's not really seeing anyone.\n\nD: Okay, that's good. And um, do you currently smoke?\n\nP: I do, I do smoke um, probably half a pack a day.\n\nD: For how long?\n\nP: Um, for probably the last 20 years.\n\nD: Okay, and do you uh, consume marijuana? \n\nP: Just um, maybe once or twice a month.\n\nD: Okay.\n\nP: Just uh, sometimes, it helps me sleep sometimes.\n\nD: Sure. Do you take any recreational drugs like cocaine, amphetamine, LSD, ecstasy, etc.?\n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: Any alcohol?\n\nP: Yeah, I drink probably uh, a beer or two every couple days.\n\nD: Alright, and uh, do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with? \n\nP: Uh yeah, so I do, they're saying I might have um, high blood pressure. Um they like, it, it's still ongoing. Um they're testing, testing me for things.\n\nD: Sure yeah, and have you uh, taken any medications for it? \n\nP: No, not yet, I haven't been put on any medications.\n\nD: Have you, do you take anything over the counter? Any herbal pills, vitamins, minerals, etc.?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Okay, and do you have any allergies?\n\nP: No allergies.\n\nD: Okay, good. Um, and have you had any surgeries in the past or any hospitalizations?\n\nP: Um I was pretty young, I had my tonsils removed um, but other than that no no other surgeries or hospitalizations.\n\nD: Good. Any family history of any medical conditions?\n\nP: Um, so I think my mother, she, she has like type 2 diabetes.\n\nD: Okay.\n\nP: And uh, my father has been pretty healthy, like no issues with him.\n\nD: Good. Um, okay, have you had any um, have you had migraines in the past?\n\nP: Um, yeah, sometimes I, when I'm like stressed at work and like I uh, it's not like anything regular that happens to me. I probably have had migraines in the past.\n\nD: Okay, okay, and have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or um, with uh, COPD?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Okay, alright, um so it sounds like you've had a headache for the past week, which has been kind of constant, about 7 out of 10. And then you've also developed a fever, but you haven't, or I guess you've been feeling, you've been having chills uh, and we can measure temperature here, and you also had a cough that started yesterday. What about um, sense of taste? Have you noticed any changes there?\n\nP: Uh, no, not that I've really noticed.\n\nD: What about your sense of smell?\n\nP: Um, my smell, I don't think so, but like sometimes I do feel a bit, like stuffy as well. Like not, not right now, but before when I felt stuffy I lost my sense of smell.\n\nD: Sure, yeah, okay. Um, okay well that's all the questions I have for you. We'll do a physical exam um, get a chest x-ray done, also examine your neck as well a little bit, just to make sure there's no stiffness or rigidity, have a look inside your mouth, um, listen to your chest.\n\nP: Okay. \n\nD: We will also get a COVID swab done, simply because your symptoms sound very similar to um, or I guess a lot of these symptoms do overlap with symptoms of COVID, so we'll do that. And um, I would require, would request that you continue to uh, stay at home if you haven't been doing so so far. Um, take a leave from work, try to do work from home, and quarantine at home as much as possible and stay away from your wife and your daughter as well, at least until the swab is back and you get some more guidance from uh, public health. If it is positive, they will give you a call. Um, there are lots of guidelines on how to self isolate and I, I can share that with you. Um, it's best that you do that for now. Um, we will run a couple of tests, do labs, and based on those results, uh, we'll decide if you need to stay in the ER or if we can um, if you can be discharged later today. Do you have any questions for me?\n\nP: Uh no that, that all sounds great. Thanks for explaining it to me. \n\nD: You're welcome. \n\nP: Okay.\n",

    "ref_norm": "what can i do for you so i have been just over the last week i have been feeling pretty sick i have this pretty bad headache that started like probably a week ago and then for the last few days i have been having these chills and i did not get a chance to measure my temperature at all but the worst thing has been just these muscle aches all over my body and that has been going on for the last 3 to 4 days sorry to hear that you are feeling so horrible over the past week let us let us try to understand this a little bit better so you have had this headache for the past week or so where exactly is it it is kind of just all across my forehead it has been going to the sides like into my temples as well okay and what does it feel like how would you describe it yeah it feels like kind of like aching i i have had headaches with throbbing before but it is not so much throbbing it is more just constant aching pain if you had to give it a number from one to 10 with 10 being the worst pain ever what number would you give it probably like a 7 0 wow yeah that sounds severe how long have you how long has it been a 7 for it is actually a bit better now but yeah like over the last week it has been a 7 i would say now it is probably around 5 okay anything that makes the headache better i i take like tylenol then like it gets relieved for a bit for like a few hours and then comes back anything that you feel makes the headaches worse any postures or positions or activity or any kind of exposure to light or sounds no it is it is just kind of there nothing makes it worse do you have nausea or vomiting no no nausea or vomiting no any sensitivity to light or sounds no okay and is it only is it only on one on one side of your head or forehead or is it on both sides it it seems like it is on both sides and have you noticed any visual changes any blurry vision with the headaches no any other visual changes no okay and you have also had chills but you said you have not checked your temperature right no i have not i have been having chills for the last few nights yeah we can definitely check your temperature here in the here and you mentioned that the muscle aches have been quite bothersome for you is it all over your body or anyone in any one muscle group it seems like it is all over okay okay and i will ask you about a couple other symptoms just to rule out any other issues that you might be having so have you noticed that you have been confused at all over the past few days no i do not think so have you had any like stiffness or rigidity in your neck maybe a little bit of a stiffness in in my neck okay then like i i do not know if that is just the muscle pain it is like kind of on my upper back lower neck area we can definitely examine that when i am doing physical examine and see how that is okay and have you had any redness in your eyes or any teary eyes no nothing like that do the headaches come and go or is it always there they are pretty much like constant throughout the day and do you have a runny nose or stuffy nose no no i do not i i think i am kind of i am developing a little cough though okay when did that start probably just yesterday i noticed myself coughing is it like a dry cough or wet cough a dry cough any sputum or any blood come out no any sore throat no any chest pain no any difficulties with breathing no any palpitations or feel like your heart is beating very fast no okay any belly pain no any nausea or vomiting nope any diarrhea or constipation no not that i have noticed any weakness in any one side of your body nope any numbness or tingling nope no okay any exposures to anyone who could be sick i have not noticed but i i do go to work and we recently switched to like in person instead of i i used to do home work but for the last month i have been going into the office i see and have you been wearing a mask yeah well i try to wear the mask sometimes like in the in the stock like lounge we like take take off the mask to eat and stuff but that is about it are you maintaining social distancing when you are taking your mask off yeah it is most of the times we are pretty socially distanced when we are eating but sometimes it is like hard to control when you know when you are going near the microwave to heat up your food and sometimes it gets hard it is a it is a fairly small room so yeah well i would i would recommend that you try to eat when people are not in the room if possible because you are putting yourself at risk like if it is a small room i think you should also talk to management or try to limit the number of people who can be in the room at a time for your own safety you know and for the safety of others working with you okay and have you traveled anywhere recently no we have been at home okay good and who do you live with i live with my young like daughter and then my wife as well okay and you do you think they might have got any contacts to anyone who is sick no they have been completely fine my daughter is like is doing school from home right now so she is not really seeing anyone okay that is good and do you currently smoke i do i do smoke probably half a pack a day for how long for probably the last 20 years okay and do you consume marijuana just maybe once or twice a month okay just sometimes it helps me sleep sometimes sure do you take any recreational drugs like cocaine amphetamine lsd ecstasy etc no nothing like that any alcohol yeah i drink probably a beer or 2 every couple days alright and do you have any medical conditions that you have been diagnosed with yeah so i do they are saying i might have high blood pressure they like it it is still ongoing they are testing testing me for things sure yeah and have you taken any medications for it no not yet i have not been put on any medications have you do you take anything over the counter any herbal pills vitamins minerals etc no okay and do you have any allergies no allergies okay good and have you had any surgeries in the past or any hospitalizations i was pretty young i had my tonsils removed but other than that no no other surgeries or hospitalizations good any family history of any medical conditions so i think my mother she she has like type 2 diabetes okay and my father has been pretty healthy like no issues with him good okay have you had any have you had migraines in the past yeah sometimes i when i am like stressed at work and like i it is not like anything regular that happens to me i probably have had migraines in the past okay okay and have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or with copd no okay alright so it sounds like you have had a headache for the past week which has been kind of constant about 7 out of 10 and then you have also developed a fever but you have not or i guess you have been feeling you have been having chills and we can measure temperature here and you also had a cough that started yesterday what about sense of taste have you noticed any changes there no not that i have really noticed what about your sense of smell my smell i do not think so but like sometimes i do feel a bit like stuffy as well like not not right now but before when i felt stuffy i lost my sense of smell sure yeah okay okay well that is all the questions i have for you we will do a physical exam get a chest x ray done also examine your neck as well a little bit just to make sure there is no stiffness or rigidity have a look inside your mouth listen to your chest okay we will also get a covid swab done simply because your symptoms sound very similar to or i guess a lot of these symptoms do overlap with symptoms of covid so we will do that and i would require would request that you continue to stay at home if you have not been doing so so far take a leave from work try to do work from home and quarantine at home as much as possible and stay away from your wife and your daughter as well at least until the swab is back and you get some more guidance from public health if it is positive they will give you a call there are lots of guidelines on how to self isolate and i i can share that with you it is best
