I've tried to stay immobilized.\n\nD: OK for the last couple of days. OK, uh, and uh, do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: Just socially, sometimes when I'm with friends or relatives like a glass of wine.\n\nD: OK, and do you use recreational drugs like marijuana or or other things such like cocaine?\n\nP: No, I've never tried that. \n\nD: OK.

Has there been any blood clots in the family before?\n\nP: I'm not sure about blood clots, but my mother had a stroke that's, is that kind of like a blood clot?\n\nD: It could be, a stroke could have had many different type of types of causes for it, and one of them could be 'cause caused by blood clot. But I wouldn't be able to say for sure.\n\nP: OK.\n\nD: Just because, yeah, there are so many different types or reasons for for having a stroke .\n\nP: I see OK.\n\nD: So yeah, so you mentioned your leg has some swelling, um do you feel as though there's any any like temperature change to your calf like is it hot?\n\nP: Uhm, I think I I don't know if it's maybe a little bit warm, but definitely swollen.\n\nD: OK, and do you feel, is there any pain to palpation? Like if you touch your calf or something like that is there pain?\n\nP: Yeah if I touch my right calf it's painful and then if I press down on it's really painful and then just on the outside of my right knee if I touch or press down it really hurts as well. \n\nD: OK. And if you move your foot so it yeah, if you dorsiflex your ankle. Or bending your your toe up towards your nose, do you end up getting any calf pain? Doing the Homan test.\n\nP: Yeah, yeah I'll try that. And yeah, I think it definitely hurts. When I when I move my or point my toes towards my nose.\n\nD: OK. OK, so I think that was everything that I wanted to ask today on history. Was there anything else that that maybe I missed?\n\nP: No, I think that's all. \n\nD: OK yeah alright so with the. I fall 2 days ago. Things that I'm thinking about right now would be possibly a muscle strain, so this could be a gastrocnemius strain to the calf muscle itself, from from the fall which could have pain when you touch it, there could be some swelling and said it would be aggravated by movements. Also could be like injuries to some of that, the ligaments there as well. And however, with this the swelling immobilization for the last two days, as well as the pain kind of being a bit progressive that with swelling and a positive Homan in test and your temperature is a little bit elevated today not quite a fever, but feverish. It does increase the suspicion for deep vein thrombosis and so I think the most likely thing right now is actually a DVT or deep vein thrombosis. And so we will order some diagnostic studies, get an ultrasound of your right calf as well as an X Ray of the right knee to to start OK.\n\nP: OK sounds good. Thank you so much.\n",

surgeries before just a no i i do not just besides a c section for one of my children i do not have any other surgeries ok i am and have you had any thrombosis before or a blood clot in the past no i have never had anything like that ok and have you been so you you have had the birth of your you pregnant at other times in the past no that was that was it ok so have you had a miscarriage before no ok any allergies to medications no allergies ok and uhm could you tell me a little bit about your uhm living situation currently like who you are living with and whereabouts you are living yeah i live with my husband and our daughter and it is just in a small townhouse just in the city ok and are you working currently i i do work from home i am actually just an accounting clerk but i most of my work is from home right now ok and any exposures to anybody who has been sick no have you traveled anywhere recently nope ok and over the last couple of days with that with the leg pain do you feel as though you have been like immobilized yeah i have been trying to just like stay rested just stay seated otherwise it hurts a lot especially after my fall so i have tried to stay immobilized ok for the last couple of days ok and do you drink alcohol just socially sometimes when i am with friends or relatives like a glass of wine ok and do you use recreational drugs like marijuana or or other things such like cocaine no i have never tried that ok and do you smoke cigarettes uhm no i do not ok i am ok so 0 and in the family are there any history of heart or lung conditions so i do not know about heart or lung conditions but my mother had a stroke in her late 60s and my father is pretty healthy ok has there been any blood clots in the family before i am not sure about blood clots but my mother had a stroke that is is that kind of like a blood clot it could be a stroke could have had many different type of types of causes for it and one of them could be cause caused by blood clot but i would not be able to say for sure ok just because yeah there are so many different types or reasons for for having a stroke i see ok so yeah so you mentioned your leg has some swelling do you feel as though there is any any like temperature change to your calf like is it hot uhm i think i i do not know if it is maybe a little bit warm but definitely swollen ok and do you feel is there any pain to palpation like if you touch your calf or something like that is there pain yeah if i touch my right calf it is painful and then if i press down on it is really painful and then just on the outside of my right knee if i touch or press down it really hurts as well ok and if you move your foot so it yeah if you dorsiflex your ankle or bending your your toe up towards your nose do you end up getting any calf pain doing the homan test yeah yeah i will try that and yeah i think it definitely hurts when i when i move my or point my toes towards my nose ok ok so i think that was everything that i wanted to ask today on history was there anything else that that maybe i missed no i think that is all ok yeah alright so with the i fall 2 days ago things that i am thinking about right now would be possibly a muscle strain so this could be a gastrocnemius strain to the calf muscle itself from from the fall which could have pain when you touch it there could be some swelling and said it would be aggravated by movements also could be like injuries to some of that the ligaments there as well and however with this the swelling immobilization for the last 2 days as well as the pain kind of being a bit progressive that with swelling and a positive homan in test and your temperature is a little bit elevated today not quite a fever but feverish it does increase the suspicion for deep vein thrombosis and so i think the most likely thing right now is actually a dvt or deep vein thrombosis and so we will order some diagnostic studies get an ultrasound of your right calf as well as an x ray of the right knee to to start ok ok sounds good thank you so much",
