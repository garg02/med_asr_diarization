I've noticed it on my um like hands a little bit too.\n\nD: OK, and you said this started when like was this before the sore throat or after? \n\nP: Oh I can't like remember the onset. I I think that the sore throat started first and maybe a rash came a little bit later. \n\nD: OK, OK and have you noticed that your that your glands are swollen?\n\nP: I think so, um maybe that's what's swollen in my neck.\n\nD: OK, OK.

I just kind of haven't been feeling so great, so I'm I've probably eating less the last few weeks, yeah.\n\nD: Have you been around anyone who may have been sick recently?\n\nP: Yeah, actually I think a few of my friends or there was somebody in my gym class knew that I sounded like they had similar symptoms. \n\nD: OK, OK, and when was this?\n\nP: Um, Uh, now that I think about it, probably about three or four weeks ago.\n\nD: OK, and were they ever treated for that? Did they see a doctor?\n\nP: Um I'm not sure. \n\nD: No, OK. No worries. \n\nP: I just remember them being off for school 'cause they were they were sick. \n\nD: OK yeah, any issues with your eyes?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, nothing like crusting or pus coming out of your eyes? Red eye, anything like that?\n\nP: Um. No, that well, did they might have looked maybe a little bit more more red, red then usual but I haven't noticed any anything in terms of itchiness or um discharge. \n\nD: OK. Any nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: Um, no nausea or vomiting. \n\nD: OK, how how about your stools? Have they been normal?

Um, have you ever had these symptoms before?\n\nP: Um, I mean I've had sore throats in the past, but not while feeling like this though. \n\nD: Yeah. OK, when was the last time you had a sore throat?\n\nP: Um, I don't know maybe when I was a kid. \n\nD: OK. \n\nP: It's been awhile.\n\nD: Yeah, like a strep throat kind of thing, or or more viral?\n\nP: Yeah, I do remember getting antibiotics when I was younger. \n\nD: OK, OK, and are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any medical conditions?\n\nP: I was diagnosed with uh with asthma. \n\nD: OK, and are you on any medications for that? \n\nP: Um yeah, so I, I just use ah Ventolin as needed, but otherwise oh and then I take Flovent daily so um.\n\nD: OK.\n\nP: I think that's the one, there's there's a couple inhalers that that I take. \n\nD: OK, OK, and any other medications?\n\nP: Uh, sometimes I'll take um like Reactine or some other type of allergy pill, but that's it. \n\nD: OK, What are you allergic too?\n\nP: Um mostly seasonal allergies, bug me like um yeah, like seasonal allergies and dust, maybe. \n\nD: OK. And are you up to date with all your immunizations?\n\nP: Yeah, my mom makes me get the flu shot every year. \n\nD: OK, good. And it's, OK, have you seen another doctor for the symptoms at all? Have you been worked up for that? Any blood work testing done for it already? \n\nP: No, I thought I would have felt better by now and so I haven't seen anybody but it's kind of just been going on now, not seeming to get better. So wanna come see somebody.\n\nD: Yeah for sure. Have you tried anything for your symptoms? Any medications, anything over the counter?\n\nP: Um yeah, I've tried some Tylenol and it's, I I think what is it Advil? And that definitely is helped with some of the kind of aches and pains, but they've come right back.\n\nD: OK, um any family history of Lung issues, heart issues?\n\nP: Um, No. nothing like that, um no.\n\nD: Yeah, OK. How about cancers?\n\nP: I, I think my Grandfather had a like pancreatic cancer. \n\nD: OK, OK. Um, alright, so do you live at home correct? \n\nP: Yeah, I live with my parents and my younger sister.

OK, are you sexually active?\n\nP: No, I'm not.\n\nD: No, OK um. Is there a possibility that? Or actually sorry I should rephrase that. Have you kissed anyone recently?\n\nP: Um I. Well, I I guess I kinda have a girlfriend now. Um that we, that I started hanging out with about two months ago.\n\nD: OK, OK. \n\nP: And so I guess yes. \n\nD: OK, alright, well that's good. Um have, has she had any of these symptoms?\n\nP: Uh, well she she was, wasn't feeling well for awhile back, but, I don't think it was this bad for her. \n\nD: OK.

And are you and your girlfriend in an exclusive relationship?\n\nP: Uh. I I think so yeah.\n\nD: OK, I ask because there's something called what you may be familiar with um it's called the kissing disease. In medical terminology, it's called mono, as caused by a virus called EBV, and so it could be that so we're covering all our bases. \n\nP: Oh, I've heard of mono before. \n\nD: Yeah, \n\nP: OK. \n\nD: It's it's likely it could be up there in terms of what you have, so I think those were all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions for me? Anything you wanted to add?\n\nP: Um, no, I think that's you covered everything. \n\nD: OK alright so I will will go off a few, we'll try to cover our basis and get you tested for mono which I would have to do like a monospot test and we can do rapid strep test as well to see if he has something called strep throat. But yeah, we'll see what those results come back as. And we'll go from there. Does that sound good? \n\nP: Yeah, no, that sounds good. \n\nD: OK, thank you.\n",

like an itchy feeling what does it feel like i would say it is kinda yeah like burnin or burning or scratchy ok and does it hurt when you swallow it does yeah if my throat hurts when i am eating or or swallowing like liquid is as well but cold stuff seems to make it feel a little bit better ok good and does your neck hurt too a little tender i have noticed the some lumps at the front of front of my neck that have been a bit sore ok and is it mostly sore kind of like midline or is it more sorta one side versus the other i would say maybe the the right side is a little bit more sore but i think i can feel it on both sides of my neck ok and how bad would you say your discomfort is one to 10 10 being the worst i would say maybe a 2 or 3 if i move my neck i i can feel it more but otherwise i can just barely notice that it is there ok so it is not preventing you from sleeping going to school playing things like that no it is more so the sore throat when swallowing ok ok have you noticed a fever at all i have yeah i felt hot and i checked my temperature this morning and it was 38.7 i think it was is that a fever yeah i would say that is a fever we can also do another temperature check today ok yeah but that definitely sounds like a fever have you noticed rashes anywhere yeah i have had this this like red i guess pink rash that i have noticed it is come over my chest and and belly area ok how big is it is it more than a centimeter huh yeah it is pretty well i mean it is kind of spread out over over an area like it is not all continuous i guess you can kind of see patches or blotches ok and is it raised no it is it is not raised ok ok is it itchy no it is not itchy painful no not painful ok and is it bleeding or oozing anything like pus no it is not nothing like that it is just pink and red and it is just kind of shown up over the last little while i have noticed it on my like hands a little bit too ok and you said this started when like was this before the sore throat or after 0 i can not like remember the onset i i think that the sore throat started 1st and maybe a rash came a little bit later ok ok and have you noticed that your that your glands are swollen i think so maybe that is what is swollen in my neck ok ok how about coughing no i have not had a cough no and how about a stuffy nose or or a runny nose nothing like that ok body aches yeah i felt so some muscle aches for sure ok upper limbs or lower limbs i say i got a whole body i just feel like my muscles and joints are sore ok yeah and or do you have any headaches no i have not really had any headaches no ok and how is your appetite are you still eating well it might be a little ah might have been a little bit down i just kind of have not been feeling so great so i am i have probably eating less the last few weeks yeah have you been around anyone who may have been sick recently yeah actually i think a few of my friends or there was somebody in my gym class knew that i sounded like they had similar symptoms ok ok and when was this now that i think about it probably about 3 or 4 weeks ago ok and were they ever treated for that did they see a doctor i am not sure no ok no worries i just remember them being off for school cause they were they were sick ok yeah any issues with your eyes no no nothing like crusting or pus coming out of your eyes red eye anything like that no that well did they might have looked maybe a little bit more more red red then usual but i have not noticed any anything in terms of itchiness or discharge ok any nausea or vomiting no nausea or vomiting ok how how about your stools have they been normal have you had diarrhea constipation anything like that no changes to bowel habits ok how about urine that has been ok ok ok have you ever had these symptoms before i mean i have had sore throats in the past but not while feeling like this though yeah ok when was the last time you had a sore throat i do not know maybe when i was a kid ok it has been awhile yeah like a strep throat kind of thing or or more viral yeah i do remember getting antibiotics when i was younger ok ok and are you otherwise healthy do you have any medical conditions i was diagnosed with with asthma ok and are you on any medications for that yeah so i i just use ah ventolin as needed but otherwise 0 and then i take flovent daily so ok i think that is the one there is there is a couple inhalers that that i take ok ok and any other medications sometimes i will take like reactine or some other type of allergy pill but that is it ok what are you allergic too mostly seasonal allergies bug me like yeah like seasonal allergies and dust maybe ok and are you up to date with all your immunizations yeah my mom makes me get the flu shot every year ok good and it is ok have you seen another doctor for the symptoms at all have you been worked up for that any blood work testing done for it already no i thought i would have felt better by now and so i have not seen anybody but it is kind of just been going on now not seeming to get better so want to come see somebody yeah for sure have you tried anything for your symptoms any medications anything over the counter yeah i have tried some tylenol and it is i i think what is it advil and that definitely is helped with some of the kind of aches and pains but they have come right back ok any family history of lung issues heart issues no nothing like that no yeah ok how about cancers i i think my grandfather had a like pancreatic cancer ok ok alright so do you live at home correct yeah

terminology it is called mono as caused by a virus called ebv and so it could be that so we are covering all our bases 0 i have heard of mono before yeah ok it is it is likely it could be up there in
