OK, uhm and have any of them been sick or have they all been pretty healthy?\n\nP: Uhm, in heard from anyone that's been sick. We we kind of have a rule that if you know if we feel sick then not to, not to show up just because, like you know, when we're when we're drinking and like smoking, we may share like a joint, so it's not like we don't want to get everyone sick if one person is sick.\n\nD: Yeah for sure. Uhm, that makes sense. Alright, any travel recently?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, OK. And where do you live right now?\n\nP: Right now I just live in an apartment by myself just outside of London.\n\nD: OK.

Did you have any questions of your own for myself?\n\nP: Uh no, I don't think so, I just wanted to see what this might be.\n\nD: Yeah, for sure. Uhm so, we are going to do a Covid swab on you because a lot of your symptoms do align with those of Covid, so we just want to rule that out first, so you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Uhm, in the meantime you should isolate for two weeks and if it's not Covid, it could be another viral infection that's been going around this time of year. Either way, kind of management plan is the same, so make sure you're hydrated, eat well, sleep well, and if your symptoms become worse, severe or there any red flags like you have neurological symptoms, like seizures or weakness where you can move your limbs, you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?\n\nP: OK. That sounds good. Thank you.\n\nD: OK yeah, no problem.\n\n",

maybe 2 glasses of whiskey in a in an average week ok ok alright and have you been in touch with or in contact with anyone sick recently no no one has been sick uhm i do meet up with some friends on the weekends some of them are from work some of them are just that that i know outside of work ok ok uhm and have any of them been sick or have they all been pretty healthy uhm in heard from anyone that has been sick we we kind of have a rule that if you know if we feel sick then not to not to show up just because like you know when we are when we are drinking and like smoking we may share like a joint so it is not like we do not want to get everyone sick if one person is sick yeah for sure uhm that makes sense alright any travel recently no no ok and where do you live right now right now i just live in an apartment by myself just outside of london ok any old carpets dust mold asbestos anything that could make your condition worse no ok so those are all the questions that i had for you did you have any questions of your own for myself no i do not think so i just wanted to see what this might be yeah for sure uhm so we are going to do a covid swab on you because a lot of your symptoms do align with those of covid so we just want to rule that out 1st so you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours uhm in the meantime you should isolate for 2 weeks and if it is not covid it could be another viral infection that has been going around this time of year either way kind of management plan is the same so make sure you are hydrated eat well sleep well and if your symptoms become worse severe or there any red flags like you have neurological symptoms like seizures or weakness where you can move your limbs you should seek help from the er how does that sound ok that sounds good thank you ok yeah no problem",
