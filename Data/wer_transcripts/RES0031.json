Anything that makes it better?\n\nP: Uh, I I think when I drink like colder liquids or ice cream, it just soothes he pain a little bit.\n\nD: OK. Any other symptoms that you been experiencing?\n\nP: Um, so I I do find that like my mom told me, that I have my voice is kind of rough and like just a little bit hoarse.

I'm still able to swallow liquids but it's just the solids that causes some pain.\n\nD: OK, have you had anything to eat today or when was the last time you had anything to eat?\n\nP: I think I did have lunch today. I wasn't able to eat too too much just because of the pain. But yeah, just a couple hours ago I had I did have a lunch.\n\nD: OK, and have you noticed any changes to your voice yourself?\n\nP: Sorry, what was that? \n\nD: Have you noticed any changes to your like do you think your voice sounds different too? \n\nP: Yeah, I definitely think um, like when I woke up this morning, my voice was definitely more like hoarse and more like raspy, almost.
