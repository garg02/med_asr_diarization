So when you're looking at your hand, are you seeing any swelling redness?\n\nP: Not swelling, I just yeah just those nodules and I get like a little bit of whiteness around those nodules when I extend my fingers.\n\nD: OK yeah, but no redness?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and are you are you seeing any, uh like muscle atrophy or any deformities of any of your joints in the fingers or the wrist?\n\nP: Nope.\n\nD: OK, and uh are there any areas that that you can palpate over your hand that causes pain.\n\nP: Yeah, there's just some discomfort, like when I at the bases of those two fingers, like if I press on the nodules like it's sometimes a little bit like uncomfortable but it's not too bad. Like I, I don't, but I don't know I have a pretty high pain threshold too, so it's hard to say.\n\nD: OK, I see an when you're extending your fingers with like passive extension to do with your other hand do you get a lot of pain like along the tendons or the passive extension?\n\nP: Yeah definitely. I would say more painful than if I try to extend it myself. Like just forcing it back but yeah, but not not anything too like I like it's not sharp or anything like that.\n\nD: OK, and with the on the nodules and stuff, do you feel any like crepitations or like crackling or rubbing over those, those areas or your palm?\n\nP: Uhm crackling oh no not that I have noticed.\n\nD: OK, and any issues with your like wrist or or elbow?\n\nP: No, not that I know of.\n\nD: OK. Uhm so I think that's everything that I wanted to ask about today. Did you have anything that you wanted to add or or did you have any questions?\n\nP: No, I think that's all.\n\nD: OK, I'm so right now it's sounding like it's most likely something called Dupuytren's contracture, but also we can't rule out like flexor tenosynovitis just yet or or trigger finger. Based on the the symptoms, but the fact that you're not having a fever, you don't have pain kind of along the the tendon, you're not seeing any swelling or redness that's all pointing away from the tenosynovitis.\n\nP: Mmmm\n\nD: But it'll be important to get some blood work and things to make sure that we're not missing that. But for Dupuytren's contracture. It'll be a uh, do doing what we can with therapy to try it like physiotherapy and activity modification to try and loosen those structures on the on the palm of your hand.\n\nP: OK, sounds good. ",

that ok and have you had any appetite loss or fatigue uhm no alright and in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions uhm they say i have like some high cholesterol i am taking this medication like a statin and but other than that umm no ok so do you take any other medications or is it just the statin it is just a statin ok and have you had any prior surgeries or hospitalizations uhm i did a have a acl repair just when i was probably 18 ok do you have any allergies no not that i know alright and are your immunizations up to date yep could you tell me a little bit about where you are living and who you are living with yeah so i just lived with my wife we live in small apartment ok and are you working right now yeah just as a construction worker been doing that for the last probably 10 years ok and have you been around anybody who has been sick no ok and sorry as a construction worker i have you had any like any puncture wounds to your hands or anything that like any like slivers or things that have gone into the skin not any puncture wounds like yeah i sometimes get splinters here and there but nothing like nothing recently that i can think of that has been anything worrying or significant alright ok and have you ever traveled anywhere recently nope been around anybody who has been sick nope do you smoke cigarettes yeah i smoke probably a pack a day for the last i do not know like 10 years ok and you smoke marijuana not that much probably just a couple times a month ok and do you drink alcohol yeah probably a couple of years a day ok like one or 2 a day yeah probably one or 2 sometimes 3 ok and you use any rec other recreational drugs at and or any iv drugs and have you in the past no i have not tried anything beyond weed i do not want to try any other stuff ok i i see and that is good then uhm anybody in the family have any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions that run in the family uhm not that i know ok and how about any autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or hypothyroidism nope ok and as anybody in the family had a dupuytren is contracture before uhm no i have not i have not heard it now ok and so next i just wanted to go on to the physical exam portion so just a couple more questions so when you are looking at your hand are you seeing any swelling redness not swelling i just yeah just those nodules and i get like a little bit of whiteness around those nodules when i extend my fingers ok yeah but no redness no ok and are you are you seeing any like muscle atrophy or any deformities of any of your joints in the fingers or the wrist nope ok and are there any areas that that you can palpate over your hand that causes pain yeah there is just some discomfort like when i at the bases of those 2 fingers like if i press on the nodules like it is sometimes a little bit like uncomfortable but it is not too bad like i i do not but i do not know i have a pretty high pain threshold too so it is hard to say ok i see an when you are extending your fingers with like passive extension to do with your other hand do you get a lot of pain like along the tendons or the passive extension yeah definitely i would say more painful than if i try to extend it myself like just forcing it back but yeah but not not anything too like i like it is not sharp or anything like that ok and with the on the nodules and stuff do you feel any like crepitations or like crackling or rubbing over those those areas or your palm uhm crackling 0 no not that i have noticed ok and any issues with your like wrist or or elbow no not that i know of ok uhm so i think that is everything that i wanted to ask about today did you have anything that you wanted to add or or did you have any questions no i think that is all ok i am so right now it is sounding like it is most likely something called dupuytren is contracture but also we can not rule out like flexor tenosynovitis just yet or or trigger finger based on the the symptoms but the fact that you are not having a fever you do not have pain kind of along the the tendon you are not seeing any swelling or redness that is all pointing away from the tenosynovitis mmmm but it will be important to get some blood work and things to make sure that we are not missing that but for dupuytren is contracture it will be a do doing what we can with therapy to try it like physiotherapy and activity modification to try and loosen those structures on the on the palm of your hand ok sounds good",
