Uhm, I just actually got out of the hospital just last week. I had a knee replacement surgery on my right leg. So yeah, I was just really concerned about this blood that I'm coughing up.\n\nD: Yeah, certainly. So when, so you had a knee surgery last week, were you like immobilized afterwards for periods of time?\n\nP:Yeah, I've been just taking some rest, not really doing too much. And even in the hospital, like I was there for a day and was pretty immobilized.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any pain in your calf, and if so, which which one?\n\nP: It's just the right calf and it's it's pretty swollen right now and I was having a lot of pain over it for the last two days.\n\nD: OK is it, can you feel the pain at rest, or or is it with uh like with movement?

Maybe like in the last couple hours, I've had three episodes of that where I've noticed blood on the tissue.\n\nD: I see and did you ever cough prior to this?\n\nP: No, not really.\n\nD: OK, uhm, and have you been experiencing any infectious symptoms like red or runny eyes, runny nose, sore throat?\n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: Have you been having any chest pain or or shortness of breath?\n\nP: No chest pain, but I do feel like I do have to take like a deeper breath. Like I've just been feeling it this morning a little bit. It's just kind of a bit of uneasy breathing.\n\nD: OK, so it has been more difficult to breathe. And is that is that at rest as well, do you feel that kind of sensation?\n\nP: Yeah, even right now, just a little bit, like it's it's not anything that I'm too worried about, but it is there.\n\nD: OK, do you have any pain if you have if if you take a deep breath in.\n\nP: Uh, no I don't, no I don't really have any pain.\n\nD: OK, and do you feel like your your heart's racing or beating really fast.\n\nP: I I do feel like my heart is beating like faster, especially today.

So that was everything that I wanted to ask about on history today. We'll do physical exam and I'll listen to your chest and have a look at your leg. We'll also order some imaging studies, with a CTPA it's called. Uh but before we go ahead with that, was there anything else that that you wanted to add?\n\nP: No, I think that's that's all.\n\nD: OK, so we'll get the lab work started, as well as the imaging ordered. It will look for, to see if there is any pulmonary embolism present, because with the surgery last week and being immobilized for a period of time, it is a risk factor for it, and leg swelling with uhm coughing up blood can be symptoms of this. So we'll wanna make sure to to do, to investigate for a pulmonary embolism.\n\nP: OK. Sounds good, thank you so much.\n\nD: Sounds good, thank you.\n",
