So I think he he should be able to breathe OK.\n\nD: OK, good, so you said no shortness of breath or trouble breathing. Has he had any coughs?\n\nP: Kind of. In the morning, so I I see that whenever he wakes up in the morning, he just has to like clear his throat a lot and like cough and then um gets better.\n\nD: OK, OK. Is he bringing up phlegm when he coughs?\n\nP: Um, a little bit. \n\nD: What colour is it? \n\nP: It's the same stuff that comes out of his nose.\n\nD: OK yeah, so no blood or pus?\n\nP: No, no.\n\nD: No? OK. Have you, do you think he's lost his like sense of smell or taste? \n\nP: Uhh no.\n\nD: No? OK. Any changes in his vision or hearing?\n\nP: Um I don't think so. \n\nD: No? Did like, um, have you noticed any discharge from his eyes?\n\nP: No, no.

Any fevers or chills?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, does he look like he's like excessively tired?\n\nP: He's a little bit fatigued because of the sneezing and the, and the runny nose. You know, he's not going out to play as much.\n\nD: Mhmm.\n\nP: Um but it's not, you know he's still, he's still cheerful. He's not irritable or anything. \n\nD: OK, OK.

Um has he been like excessively itching anywhere?\n\nP: Um just his uh, just his nose and I think his like, I think his mouth is itchy too, 'cause he keeps doing this thing with his tongue just kind of, I don't know, just kind of like\nitching the top of his mouth with his tongue or something.\n\nD: OK.\n\nP: Um yeah just like his face is itchy.\n\nD: Hmm, OK. Um, has he come into any contact with sick people recently?\n\nP: Um, I don't, maybe. So, two weeks ago he was playing outside, um and I know that he, he does, his symptoms do get worse when he's outside, so I don't know, maybe.\n\nD: OK.\n\nP: He was playing with uh, with his brother but then this other kid from the neighbourhood also came around.\n\nD: OK, OK. How about um travel to anywhere?\n\nP: No, we've just been staying at home.\n\nD: OK, OK good. Um is he an otherwise healthy kid at the moment?\n\nP: Yeah, yeah, he's an, he's a healthy kid.\n\nD: OK, um any complications when you were pregnant with him?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: No?

He's never been diagnosed with like eczema or asthma? \n\nP: Oh he's, he's had eczema. He had it.\n\nD: OK. \n\nP: Yeah, comes and goes.\n\nD: His eczema comes and goes?\n\nP: Hmm. \n\nD: OK, um is he on any medications?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: No? Even for his eczema?\n\nP: It's pretty mild.\n\nD: OK. Um has, have you ever like given him um Reactine or like any of the, those anti allergy medications in the past? \n\nP: I've tried the, uh, yeah, the ones over the counter, um, they do help. Um, I tried it this time, but uh it didn't do much.\n\nD: OK. OK. And, I was gonna ask you something else. Um, his symptoms, like the sneezing and the, and the runny nose, like has he experienced this before?\n\nP: Oh yeah.\n\nD: OK.\n\nP: It usually gets worse um uh I guess like around this time, uh I can tell when spring is coming up. Um, it gets pretty bad, but he always has a runny nose um and he sneezes sometimes here and there.\n\nD: OK, and you mentioned this has been going on for more than four days this time around? \n\nP: It's been, it's been going on for the past uh two weeks. \n\nD: OK. OK, and is it like um impairing his like daily activities or like his ability to um like, sleep?  \n\nP: Uh it does affect his sleep sometimes he doesn't like um, just the itching really bothers him.\n\nD: Mhmm.\n\nP: So he can't uh, he finds it hard to fall asleep. That's like, I usually, that's when I give him the the medications. To help him fall asleep. \n\nD: OK. OK. And uh is he up to date with all his immunizations?\n\nP: Yeah. \n\nD: OK. Any family history of asthma, eczema, or something called allergic rhinitis?\n\nP: Uh I have asthma. \n\nD: OK. And is your asthma severe?\n\nP: Uh no, it's it's pretty well controlled. I used to, actually, I used to have asthma as a child. \n\nD: OK, I see.\n\nP: It's pretty well controlled right now. I don't even need medications.\n\nD: OK, OK.\n\nP: I remember I used to, I used to get allergies as well as a child.\n\nD: Oh I see. \n\nP: But very similar, lots of sneezing and yeah.\n\nD: Mhmm, alright. Were you ever, did you ever take like an allergy test?\n\nP: No. I didn't think about it, I just never, like my my my parents didn't take me to get that testing done.\n\nD: OK, how about your son? Has he been allergy tested?\n\nP: No, but I feel like he probably should.\n\nD: Yeah, OK. And then, does anyone at home smoke?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: No, OK. Um do you have any, like old carpets, dust, mold, or asbestos at your place?\n\nP: Uh we've got all of, we got our carpets uh removed uh two years ago. That's actually helped uh with his symptoms. Uh and I know, we tried it, we removed the curtains as well and we've used blinds. So yeah. \n\nD: OK.\n\nP: And I don't think so, I don't think there's any spores or things like that.\n\nD: OK, good. Um, is he an otherwise healthy child like developmental wise, like he's growing, gaining weight OK, like he's, his motor skills and like social behaviours are all up to par with his peers?\n\nP: Oh yeah he's doing great.\n\nD: OK OK good um those are all the questions I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, OK. So for him um it sounds more in keeping with something called allergic rhinitis than an infection, but because his symptoms do overlap with that of Covid,  we'll probably get him a swab anyways, and those results should come back in 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, rhinitis is, allergic rhinitis is caused by allergies to certain things, so we can get him allergy tested um and that will give us a better understanding of like what his triggers are and the way to treat that is to avoid those triggers, those allergens. And if his symptoms are persistent, um we will prescribe him also like an intranasal corticosteroid. Um and there are like, there are like second line treatments as well, like antihistamines and leukotriene, like leukotriene receptor antagonists, but those are like second line. We'll we'll see how he does with the inhaled corticosteroids at first. How does that sound?\n\nP: Sounds great.\n\nD: OK, great.\n\nP: Thank you.\n\nD: No problem.",

    "ref_norm": "what brings you in hi i am here with my son and he is just been feeling awful he just has this runny nose and he has been sneezing all the time and i do not know maybe he has allergies or something i just came in cause i wanted to get him checked out and maybe get some medications he is just feeling horrible yeah for sure when did when did the sneezing and runny nose start he he is had it for he is just always kind of you know he is always having that runny nose you know kids always do but it is just been pretty bad over the past 2 weeks past 2 weeks ok what started 1st the sneezing or runny nose the runny nose kind of just got worse a little bit over the past 2 weeks and then the sneezing kind of started at about the same time ok and and the runny nose is he having like what color is it it is just clear like clear ok does he ever feel like he is do you ever feel like he is stuffy yeah kind of he is just been snorting and sniffing and i do not think he knows how to blow his nose yet but he is like clearing his throat so i think he is he is a little bit stuffy okay but he has not complained about difficulty with breathing or like he has been like he sleeps with his mouth closed so i think he he should be able to breathe ok ok good so you said no shortness of breath or trouble breathing has he had any coughs kind of in the morning so i i see that whenever he wakes up in the morning he just has to like clear his throat a lot and like cough and then gets better ok ok is he bringing up phlegm when he coughs a little bit what color is it it is the same stuff that comes out of his nose ok yeah so no blood or pus no no no ok have you do you think he is lost his like sense of smell or taste uhh no no ok any changes in his vision or hearing i do not think so no did like have you noticed any discharge from his eyes no no sometimes he does have that but no not in the past 2 weeks ok so his like eyelids are not swollen or his eyes are not red no no no no ok and does he have you noticed any swelling in his either like face neck like belly area or his limbs no no i have not it is just his nose is like a little bit red ok and yeah he is just he is just itching all the time just itching his nose itching his ears yeah but no no swelling no swelling have you noticed any rashes on him no i checked yesterday night very carefully ok good any weight loss no he has been gaining weight so good that he has been eating well yeah that is good any fevers or chills no no does he look like he is like excessively tired he is a little bit fatigued because of the sneezing and the and the runny nose you know he is not going out to play as much mhmm but it is not you know he is still he is still cheerful he is not irritable or anything ok ok and then have you noticed that he is like taking in like rapid breaths no no his breathing has been good ok how about his bowel movements have those been normal yeah yeah ok any nausea or vomiting no how about his urine no no problems there ok how about like dizziness or fainting spells no no no i did not notice anything like that no any confusion that you noticed no headaches no no ok has he been like excessively itching anywhere just his just his nose and i think his like i think his mouth is itchy too cause he keeps doing this thing with his tongue just kind of i do not know just kind of like ok yeah just like his face is itchy ok has he come into any contact with sick people recently i do not maybe so 2 weeks ago he was playing outside and i know that he he does his symptoms do get worse when he is outside so i do not know maybe ok he was playing with with his brother but then this other kid from the neighborhood also came around ok ok how about travel to anywhere no we have just been staying at home ok ok good is he an otherwise healthy kid at the moment yeah yeah he is an he is a healthy kid ok any complications when you were pregnant with him no no how about at birth no no complications ok did he need to be hospitalized after birth for any reason no any surgeries no any allergies i do not think so i know he is not no he is never been diagnosed with like eczema or asthma 0 he is he is had eczema he had it ok yeah comes and goes his eczema comes and goes ok is he on any medications no no even for his eczema it is pretty mild ok has have you ever like given him reactine or like any of the those anti allergy medications in the past i have tried the yeah the ones over the counter they do help i tried it this time but it did not do much ok ok and i was going to ask you something else his symptoms like the sneezing and the and the runny nose like has he experienced this before 0 yeah ok it usually gets worse i guess like around this time i can tell when spring is coming up it gets pretty bad but he always has a runny nose and he sneezes sometimes here and there ok and you mentioned this has been going on for more than 4 days this time around it has been it has been going on for the past 2 weeks ok ok and is it like impairing his like daily activities or like his ability to like sleep it does affect his sleep sometimes he does not like just the itching really bothers him mhmm so he can not he finds it hard to fall asleep that is like i usually that is when i give him the the medications to help him fall asleep ok ok and is he up to date with all his immunizations yeah ok any family history of asthma eczema or something called allergic rhinitis i have asthma ok and is your asthma severe no it is it is pretty well controlled i used to actually i used to have asthma as a child ok i see it is pretty well controlled right now i do not even need medications ok ok i remember i used to i used to get allergies as well as a child 0 i see but very similar lots of sneezing and yeah mhmm alright were you ever did you ever take like an allergy test no i did not think about it i just never like my my my parents did not take me to get that testing done ok how about your son has he been allergy tested no but i feel like he probably should yeah ok and then does anyone at home smoke no no ok do you have any like old carpets dust mold or asbestos at your place we have got all of we got our carpets removed 2 years ago that is actually helped with his symptoms and i know we tried it we removed the curtains as well and we have used blinds so yeah ok and i do not think so i do not think there is any spores or things like that ok good is he an otherwise healthy child like developmental wise like he is growing gaining weight ok like he is his motor skills and like social behaviors are all up to par with his peers 0 yeah he is doing great ok ok good those are all the questions i had for you today did you have any questions of your own no no ok so for him it sounds more in keeping with something called allergic rhinitis than an infection but because his symptoms do overlap with that of covid we will probably get him a swab anyways and those results should come back in 24 to 48 hours in the meantime rhinitis is allergic rhinitis is caused by allergies to certain things so we can get him allergy tested and that will give us a better understanding of like what his triggers are and the way to treat that is to avoid those triggers those allergens and if his symptoms are persistent we will prescribe him also like an intranasal corticosteroid and there are like there are like 2nd line treatments as well like antihistamines and leukotriene like leukotriene receptor antagonists but those are like 2nd line we will we will see how he does with the inhaled corticosteroids at 1st how does that sound sounds great ok great thank you no problem",
