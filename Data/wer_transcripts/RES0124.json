Yeah, and then also like, I remember when I was walking down the street and someone was smoking and then I just completely just started having that episode right after I walked past them.\n\nD: Okay um, alright. Uh um okay, sorry, one moment. Okay um, so is there anything that makes your cough better? What do you do to make it go away?\n\nP: Uh, I just basically have to, if I, if I'm doing any kind of activities, just take a moment, sit down for like 10 to 15 minutes and then it seems like it goes away on its own.\n\nD: And you said that sometimes you also have difficulties breathing with it?\n\nP: Yeah, like a couple of times it got really bad where I had to um like, it was difficult get, it was, it was like I was trying to take deep breaths for air, but uh it was, it just felt like I couldn't.\n\nD: I see. So this started a couple of months ago, has this ever happened to you before that?\n\nP: No, before that I've been fine.\n\nD: Okay, and so I'm going to ask you about a couple other symptoms. Let me know if you've experienced any of these in the past couple of months. Um, so have you had a headache that accompanies the cough? \n\nP: Uh no.\n\nD: Um, any changes in your vision or your hearing?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Any confusion? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Um any, um, runny nose or stuffy nose or sinus congestion?\n\nP: Uh no, not really.\n\nD: Okay, any sore throat? \n\nP: Uh no.\n\nD: Any um, chest pain?\n\nP: Um, sometimes when I get like really bad coughing fits, like it sometimes starts hurting in my chest as well. \n\nD: Yeah. Um, does it go away when you stop coughing?\n\nP: Yeah, it goes away after, I just take some rest. \n\nD: Um, have you had any belly pain? \n\nP: Uh no, not at all.\n\nD: Do you feel like your heart's racing? \n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: Any changes in your, any nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any changes in your bowel movements?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Any acid reflux?\n\nP: Uh, no. \n\nD: Okay, um, and any certain muscle aches or joint pains?\n\nP: Um no, nothing like that. \n\nD: Any numbness or tingling in your arms or legs?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Okay, let's get back. Okay, great, it sounds like that the, the cough is sort of the main symptom here that you have. Um, is the cough dry or wet?\n\nP: It's usually uh, it's usually dry.\n\nD: Uh sorry, can you say that again?\n\nP: It's usually dry.\n\nD: Okay um, have you ever brought up any sputum or any blood?\n\nP: Uh never any blood, I have like on occasion, like sometimes brought up some sputum.\n\nD: Okay, alright. Um okay, and, uh, have you been vaccinated?\n\nP: Uh, yeah, all my immunizations are up to date.\n\nD: Okay, good good good. Um, does the cough sound like a barky cough or a muffled cough, or um, does it have a specific characteristic? Does it sound different than when you're sort of coughing to clear your throat, for instance? \n\nP: Uh yeah, it's like pretty, it can get pretty harsh. I also noticed like uh, there's like this weird noise I started making like right after when I'm trying to take deep breaths in.\n\nD: Okay, okay. Okay, so you're wheezing. Okay, so you ever um, cough so much that you end up vomiting?\n\nP: No, no that hasn't happen yet. \n\nD: Um, and do you, so you mentioned that it's worse when you're in the cold or exercising, and smoking makes it worse? What about things like dust or pollen? Um, say when you're cleaning the house and there's also dust, does that make things worse, or is it worse in a specific time of the year when you're outdoors?\n\nP: Uh, now that you mention it, yeah, like if we're ever in the basement or anything like that, I, I do start getting like kind of irritation um, in my throat, and that kind of, sometimes I have also coughed at those times.\n\nD: Alright. Uh, can you tell me, okay so, can you tell me if you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with? \n\nP: No, nothing else, I've been pretty healthy. \n\nD: Okay. Had, did, when you were a child, did you have any sort of rash? Did you have eczema?\n\nP: Oh I, yeah, so I did I, at one point I was using like this cream um, probably when I was ten. Just for some eczema on my hands. \n\nD: Okay. And um, have you ever had allergic rhinitis, which is basically sort of having um, red or teary eyes, itchiness on the face, a runny nose at certain times of the year, or in um, areas with mold or dust, or termites and things like that? Have you had anything like that as a child or right now?\n\nP: Uh, not that I know of, no.\n\nD: Okay. Alright, uh do you have any, um, I guess going back, were you a healthy child, growing up?\n\nP: Yeah, as far as I know, I, I didn't really have any concerns from like the school or home at all.\n\nD: Okay, that's great. Do you uh, did you ever have any hospitalizations? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Any surgeries? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Are you taking any medications?\n\nP: Uh, no medications.\n\nD: Are you still using the eczema cream?\n\nP: No, no. That kind of just went away on its own, or like right after I used the cream. Like it's good now. \n\nD: Okay, good. Are you allergic to anything?\n\nP: No, I don't think so. Maybe just like environmental allergies sometimes, in the springtime.\n\nD: What happens then?\n\nP: Um, just sometimes like uh, I don't know if it's like a pollen allergy like I, I do get some, I guess I do get like some nasal congestion and things like that. \n\nD: Um, have you ever seen an allergist?\n\nP: No, I haven't.\n\nD: No. Uh, who prescribed the cream for the eczema? \n\nP: Um, just a, it was like at a walk-in clinic.\n\nD: Okay, okay. Um alright, and do you have any family history of any um, lung-related problems? Or any other problems?\n\nP: Um, my older sister has asthma, and uh, I don't know if anyone else in the family has asthma. Um, I think my father has high blood pressure.\n\nD: Alright, and you mentioned that things are going well at school. Um, who do you live with at home?\n\nP: Yeah so I live with my older sister, and my mom and dad.\n\nD: Okay, okay. And things are good at home? Do you feel safe?\n\nP: Yeah, yeah, I feel completely safe.\n\nD: Any concerns about bullying at school?\n\nP: No, no, not at all. \n\nD: Okay are you uh, are you taking any marijuana or any street drugs?\n\nP: No, no, my parents would kill me.\n\nD: What about alcohol?\n\nP: Uh, I'll come, I've, I haven't tried it um, yet, at all.\n\nD: Okay, okay. Just wanted to mention that the conversation that we're having right now is confidential between you and me. Um, unless you mentioned anything that harms you or harms anyone else so, so feel free to discuss whatever or talk openly about um, any issues that you have. Um, okay, and um, are you sexually active?\n\nP: No, no. \n\nD: Alright, okay. So um, that's all the information I needed. Uh given that you've had these coughing fits for the past couple of months that are, that have certain triggers, uh, and also given that you've had a history of eczema, and your sister has asthma, so kind of, sort of runs in your family in a way. You might also have a diagnosis of asthma potentially. Um, and so, what I would recommend is that you get um, testing done and um, uh I guess before I sort of talk a little more about this, I just want to get a sense of how severe your asthma, if it's asthma at all, um if, does it, does it affect your ability to, you said school was going okay, does it affect your ability to do well at school at all?\n\nP: Um definitely in, in gym class, but other than that it hasn't really affected me.\n\nD: Does it wake you up at night?\n\nP: No, so far no. I, I like, I get pretty good sleep.\n\nD: Okay, okay. Um, and how often, I guess is, do these episodes occur? How many times a week, or how many times a month?\n\nP: Uh, so they just started like two months ago, and I've had like maybe four or five of them in total.\n\nD: Okay, okay. Uh, and they kind of get better on their own. Okay, so we can sort of talk about these, sorry, puffers that you might need to, to use as needed. Um, your sister might have some of those, so you might be familiar with what I'm talking about. \n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: Um, so we can talk about that. Um, given that your symptoms are, yes, they've been occurring for the past couple of months, but because you have had a cough, it might be a good idea just to have a COVID test done once. Um, I don't think that's what you have, seeing that this, these symptoms have been lasting for, have been occurring for the past two months, so we'll just kind of do that test to rule it out. Um, in the meantime, I would recommend that you um, try this inhaled corticosteroid puffer that you can use, that you should use on a daily basis, and try to avoid uh, the triggers. So the things that you, that cause these symptoms. Um, we can go over how to use uh, a puffer properly and I will also give you a spacer, which will help deliver most of that medication in the, uh, to your lungs. Do you have any questions?\n\nP: Uh no, I don't have any questions at all. Thank you so much.\n",

should use on a daily basis and try to avoid the triggers so the things that cause these symptoms we can go over how to use a buffer properly and i will also give you a spacer which will help deliver most of that medication to your lungs do you have any questions",
    "pred_norm_p": "yeah i just came in here today lately for the last couple of months i have been getting these coughing fits they do not really seem to be going away and i was a bit concerned i would say probably during the winter it kind of started where i started having just these coughing fits when i am walking to school and then also during my gym class i started having these coughing fits and sometimes i also felt like i could not breathe yeah and then also i remember when i was walking down the street and someone was smoking and then i just completely just started having that episode right after i walked past them i just basically have to if i am doing any kind of activities just take a moment sit down for like 10 to 15 minutes and then it seems like it goes away on its own yeah like a couple times it got really bad where i had to like it was difficult getting it was like i was trying to take deep breaths for air but it was it just felt like i could not no before that i have been fine no no no no not really no sometimes when i get like really bad coughing fits like it sometimes starts hurting in my chest as well yeah it goes away after i just take some rest no not at all no no no no nothing like that no it is usually dry it is usually dry never any blood i have like on occasion like sometimes brought up some sputum yeah all my immunizations are up to date yeah it can get pretty harsh i also notice like there is like this weird noise i start making like right after when i am trying to take deep breaths in no no that has not happened yet now that you mention it yeah like if we are ever in the basement or anything like that i do start getting like kind of irritation in my throat and that kind of sometimes i have also coughed at those times no nothing else i have been pretty healthy 0 yeah so i did at one point i was using like this cream probably when i was 10 just for some eczema on my hands not that i know of no yeah as far as i know i did not really have any concerns from like school or home at all no no no medications no no that kind of just went away on its own or like right after i used the cream it is good now no i do not think so maybe just like environmental allergies sometimes in the springtime just sometimes like i do not know if it is like a pollen allergy like i do get some i guess i do get like some nasal congestion and things like that no i have not no just it was like at a walking clinic my older sister has asthma and i do not know if anyone else in the family has asthma i think my father has high blood pressure so i live with my older sister and my mom and dad yeah yeah i feel completely safe no no not at all no no my parents would kill me alcohol i have not tried it yet at all okay no no definitely in gym class but other than that it has not really affected me no so far no i get pretty good sleep so they just started like 2 months ago and i have had like maybe 4 or 5 of them in total yeah no i do not have any questions at all thank you so much",
    "ref_norm": "what brings you in today yeah hi i just came in here today cause lately for the last couple of months i have been getting these coughing fits they do not really seem to be going away and i was a bit concerned so you have had this when did this start i would say probably during the winter it it kind of started where i started having just coughing fits when i am walking to school and then also during like gym class i started having these coughing fits and sometimes i also felt like i could not breathe okay okay what did you is there anything so it is basically worse when you are doing some sort of an exercise such as walking or being in the gym class and it is also worse in the cold yeah yeah and then also like i remember when i was walking down the street and someone was smoking and then i just completely just started having that episode right after i walked past them okay alright okay sorry one moment okay so is there anything that makes your cough better what do you do to make it go away i just basically have to if i if i am doing any kind of activities just take a moment sit down for like 10 to 15 minutes and then it seems like it goes away on its own and you said that sometimes you also have difficulties breathing with it yeah like a couple of times it got really bad where i had to like it was difficult get it was it was like i was trying to take deep breaths for air but it was it just felt like i could not i see so this started a couple of months ago has this ever happened to you before that no before that i have been fine okay and so i am going to ask you about a couple other symptoms let me know if you have experienced any of these in the past couple of months so have you had a headache that accompanies the cough no any changes in your vision or your hearing no any confusion no any runny nose or stuffy nose or sinus congestion no not really okay any sore throat no any chest pain sometimes when i get like really bad coughing fits like it sometimes starts hurting in my chest as well yeah does it go away when you stop coughing yeah it goes away after i just take some rest have you had any belly pain no not at all do you feel like your heart is racing no any changes in your any nausea or vomiting no any changes in your bowel movements no any acid reflux no okay and any certain muscle aches or joint pains no nothing like that any numbness or tingling in your arms or legs no okay let us get back okay great it sounds like that the the cough is sort of the main symptom here that you have is the cough dry or wet it is usually it is usually dry sorry can you say that again it is usually dry okay have you ever brought up any sputum or any blood never any blood i have like on occasion like sometimes brought up some sputum okay alright okay and have you been vaccinated yeah all my immunizations are up to date okay good good good does the cough sound like a barky cough or a muffled cough or does it have a specific characteristic does it sound different than when you are sort of coughing to clear your throat for instance yeah it is like pretty it can get pretty harsh i also noticed like there is like this weird noise i started making like right after when i am trying to take deep breaths in okay okay okay so you are wheezing okay so you ever cough so much that you end up vomiting no no that has not happen yet and do you so you mentioned that it is worse when you are in the cold or exercising and smoking makes it worse what about things like dust or pollen say when you are cleaning the house and there is also dust does that make things worse or is it worse in a specific time of the year when you are outdoors now that you mention it yeah like if we are ever in the basement or anything like that i i do start getting like kind of irritation in my throat and that kind of sometimes i have also coughed at those times alright can you tell me okay so can you tell me if you have any medical conditions that you have been diagnosed with no nothing else i have been pretty healthy okay had did when you were a child did you have any sort of rash did you have eczema 0 i yeah so i did i at one point i was using like this cream probably when i was 10 just for some eczema on my hands okay and have you ever had allergic rhinitis which is basically sort of having red or teary eyes itchiness on the face a runny nose at certain times of the year or in areas with mold or dust or termites and things like that have you had anything like that as a child or right now not that i know of no okay alright do you have any i guess going back were you a healthy child growing up yeah as far as i know i i did not really have any concerns from like the school or home at all okay that is great do you did you ever have any hospitalizations no any surgeries no are you taking any medications no medications are you still using the eczema cream no no that kind of just went away on its own or like right after i used the cream like it is good now okay good are you allergic to anything no i do not think so maybe just like environmental allergies sometimes in the springtime what happens then just sometimes like i do not know if it is like a pollen allergy like i i do get some i guess i do get like some nasal congestion and things like that have you ever seen an allergist no i have not no who prescribed the cream for the eczema just a it was like at a walk in clinic okay okay alright and do you have any family history of any lung related problems or any other problems my older sister has asthma and i do not know if anyone else in the family has asthma i think my father has high blood pressure alright and you mentioned that things are going well at school who do you live with at home yeah so i live with my older sister and my mom and dad okay okay and things are good at home do you feel safe yeah yeah i feel completely safe any concerns about bullying at school no no not at all okay are you are you taking any marijuana or any street drugs no no my parents would kill me what about alcohol i will come i have i have not tried it yet at all okay okay just wanted to mention that the conversation that we are having right now is confidential between you and me unless you mentioned anything that harms you or harms anyone else so so feel free to discuss whatever or talk openly about any issues that you have okay and are you sexually active no no alright okay so that is all the information i needed given that you have had these coughing fits for the past couple of months that are that have certain triggers and also given that you have had a history of eczema and your sister has asthma so kind of sort of runs in your family in a way you might also have a diagnosis of asthma potentially and so what i would recommend is that you get testing done and i guess before i sort of talk a little more about this i just want to get a sense of how severe your asthma if it is asthma at all if does it does it affect your ability to you said school was going okay does it affect your ability to do well at school at all definitely in in gym class but other than that it has not really affected me does it wake you up at night no so far no i i like i get pretty good sleep okay okay and how often i guess is do these episodes occur how many times a week or how many times a month so they just started like 2 months ago and i have had like maybe 4 or 5 of them in total okay okay and they kind of get better on their own okay so we can sort of talk about these sorry puffers that you might need to to use as needed your sister might have some of those so you might be familiar with what i am talking about yeah so we can talk about that given that your symptoms are yes they have been occurring for the past couple of months but because you have had a cough it might be a good idea just to have a covid test done once i do not think that is what you have seeing that this these symptoms have been lasting for have been occurring for the past 2 months so we will just kind of do that test to rule it out in the meantime i would recommend that you try this inhaled corticosteroid puffer that you can use that you should use on a daily basis and try to avoid the triggers so the things that you that cause these symptoms we can go over how to use a puffer properly and i will also give you a
