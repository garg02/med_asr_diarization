Um alright, so it's sounding like most likely this would be strep throat or, or Group A strep pharyngitis with, because you have no cough, and with a high fever and swelling that you've been redness that you notice in the back of your mouth. And so we'll do a rapid strep antigen test and it will require just a throat swab. To see, to to detect for that, however with a, uh, umm, yeah, I guess that's it. That's what I yeah, well, we'll start with with that now and it could potentially be something like uhm, a viral illness, but that's lower on the on the differential then the bacterial infection is right now. And because of COVID it will be, we'll do a swab as well because people can get fever and sore throat with with COVID as well. \n\nP: Ok.\n\nD: So just to make sure that we're being comprehensive.\n\nP: OK. That sounds good. Thank you so much. \n\nD: Thank you.\n\n",

be something like uhm a viral illness but that is lower on the on the differential then the bacterial infection is right now and because of covid it will be we will do a swab as well because people can get fever and sore throat with with covid as well ok so just to make sure that we are being comprehensive ok that sounds good thank you so much thank you",
    "ref_norm_d": "how may i help you yeah for sure so you said that the sore throat started 3 days ago has it been getting any better or any worse ok is it painful to swallow food or liquids ok and how is your umm have you had any voice changes like a hot potato voice or sound like muffled or any voice changes at all ok and have you noticed any like neck swelling ok and how about your appetite has that changed right ok that makes sense and so you mentioned that you also had a fever when did that start ok ok and did did you check it ok alright so yeah certainly a fever ok and have you had any like any runny nose how about any red eyes or itchy eyes or eye discharge ok how about any loss or changes to your sense of smell or taste ok have you had any any headaches ok how about any cough no coughing ok and how about any shortness of breath ok have you had any wheezing how about any chest pain any fainting or dizziness ok and have you had any heart palpitations ok and so you do not you have not had any cough but have you had any instances of bringing up any sputum or or any blood ok and have you had any nausea or vomiting have you had any abdominal pain you had any diarrhea or or constipation ok how about any urinary problems i see ok and any skin changes or rashes alright any muscle aches or body pains and any and how is your energy been have you had fatigue ok and have you had any have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past ok and insulin wise do you use a pump or is it like how do you manage diabetes ok excellent and do you see an endocrinologist for that ok well that is good and have you had any complications or have things been stable ok and you can recognize those signs like feeling jittery and sweaty might maybe a little anxious when that comes on ok that is great that you can recognize that those signs it is important and have you had any allergies any and all your immunizations up to date ok uhm and any hospitalizations or surgeries before ok and currently are you in in school or working ok err half days like in person ok have you been around anybody who has been sick ok uhm and have you traveled anywhere ok i see an are you ah who are you living with ok and anybody at home have any sore throat or cough or or anything like that ok ok and does she need any treatment ok and and i i know people around your age might experiment with drugs or alcohol have you used anything like that or your friends ok and do you smoke cigarettes or have you tried ok and and do you smoke cannabis or use cannabis products ok and and is there a family history of any heart or or lung conditions ok i see how old was he roughly ok i am sorry to hear that and thank you and 0 sorry i forgot to ask her are you currently sexually active ok have you been sexually active before ok so umm ok uhm so that was all the questions that uhm that that i wanted to ask was there anything else that you wanted to umm mention today ok and have you looked does it look like you have like redness in the back of your back of your mouth ok and it is sore ok so it is just to kind of summarize this happens like this sometimes you been having so the sore throat like the redness and swelling of the tonsils in the back of your mouth as well as a fever and being pretty tired over these last few days ok yeah alright so it is sounding like most likely this would be strep throat or or group a strep pharyngitis with because you have no cough and with a high fever and swelling that you have been redness that you notice in the back of your mouth and so we will do a rapid strep antigen test and it will require just a throat swab to see to to detect for that however with a umm yeah i guess that is it that is what i yeah well we will start with with that now and it could potentially be something like uhm a viral illness but that is lower on the on the differential then the bacterial infection is right now and because of covid it will be we will do a swab as well because people can get fever and sore throat with with covid as well so just to make sure that we are being comprehensive thank you",
