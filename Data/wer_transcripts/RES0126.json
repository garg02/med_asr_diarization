And do you find yourself ever having to wake up at night and gasp gasping for air?\n\nP: No, it hasn't gotten that far but seeing how bad it's been over the past two months and how fast is progressing, I won't be surprised if I can't even sleep.

And are you getting any kind of significant weight loss? \n\nP: No. \n\nD: No, then your weight's been fine?\n\nP: It's been the same. Although I have been eating quite a lot more now with the pandemic and being home, you know that might be still in the same.\n\nD: And so are you having, do you feel like tired throughout the day or increased fatigue? \n\nP: Oh my God. So tired I can, you know, with the difficulty breathing I feel like all my energy spent just trying to, trying to get to the bathroom.\n\nD: OK, and how? Is there like? How much do you walk or move around that you get short of breath? Or are you short of breath at rest as well?\n\nP: Uhm? I'm short of breath all the time.

I did.\n\nD: They never sent you home with any like oxygen tank or anything like that? OK.\n\nP: Although they told me my COPD was pretty bad. That I might need to get oxygen at some point. \n\nD: I see. And have you, when you in hospital, did they give you antibiotics or when you went home?\n\nP: Yeah. Yeah they did. they did. \n\nD: Did they tell you you had pneumonia at all at any point?\n\nP: I don't think so.\n\nD: No. OK, OK any any changes or do you get any chest pain at all?\n\nP: Uhm, sometimes when I breathe in very deep.\n\nD: I see. Any any kind of sensation that your heart is racing? \n\nP: No. \n\nD: No. OK Any kind of issues with your sleep or appetite?\n\nP: Umm. Well, no, not really. It's just the difficulty breathing sometimes it's been hard to sleep.\n\nD: OK, any any exposure to any fumes or allergens in your household, any animals, pets? \n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. And other than COPD, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?\n\nP: No, I'm pretty healthy otherwise.\n\nD: OK, do you have any allergies at all to medications or environmental allergies?\n\nP: I'm allergic to cats.\n\nD: To cats, OK, do you have a cat? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: No OK. Have you been around any cats recently?\n\nP: Nope\n\nD: No OK, are you on any medications besides the puffers?\n\nP: Nope\n\nD: OK, and so you use the ventolin and then what's the other puffer that you use?\n\nP: Uhm I don't remember the name. \n\nD: Do you know the color at all? \n\nP: It's orange \n\nD: orange OK. So you've had four hospitalizations in the past year. Any surgeries in the past?\n\nP: I had a knee replacement on my right side. \n\nD: OK, and when was that?\n\nP: 10 years ago \n\nD: OK. Do you have any family history of any lung conditions, heart conditions, any cancers?\n\nP: My dad had COPD as well. \n\nD: OK. And any lung cancers in the family? \n\nP: no.\n\nD: No, so currently do you work at all?\n\nP: I'm retired.\n\nD: OK, and what did you do before you retired?\n\nP: I was I was a mechanic at Chrysler's.\n\nD: OK, and during your work, were you ever exposed to any chemicals or any kind of in your\n workplace or home exposed to any asbestos or anything like that?\n\nP: Not that I'm aware of. \n\nD: OK. And how long have you been smoking for?\n\nP: Oh yeah, I was a teenager when I started.\n\nD: OK, and how much do you smoke on a on a daily basis?\n\nP: I smoke, I smoke a pack a day\n\nD: OK. Have you at all tried to quit before? \n\nP: I can't quit. It's not gonna happen. A lot of people have told me try to quit but I I just can't live without it and I'm 75 now, you know. Like I'm not gonna live a lot longer anyway.\n\nD: Yeah yeah but also even if you try to cut down some of your symptoms might get better. Like even though you're 75, you can definitely have improvement in some of your symptoms that you're having, like the shortness of breath and coughing. So if at all that you you want to consider cutting down and gradually. we can talk about that more as well. \n\nP: Sure\n\nD: OK, and do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana? \n\nP: No\n\nD: Do you drink?\n\nP: No \n\nD: No, OK, so yeah, those are all the questions I have for you. Do you have any questions for me? \n\nP: No, I just I guess I need to be admitted right? Just like those other COPD exacerbations? I'm thinking this is exactly that and I'll have to stay in the hospital, right? for a couple of days\n\nD: Yeah, so we definitely before deciding on whether or not you should be admitted, since you said the Ventolin is not working for you, we will definitely give you some some ventilation and perhaps steroid for just to get rid of some of your symptoms right now, and we want to also make sure since you're having like cough as well as shortness of breath to do a covid swab on you, just in case. I know you've been like isolating and everything, but just in case I will do that and we'll get like a chest x ray on you as well, just to see if there's any kind of pneumonia going on. And then from there we'll also get your blood work, and then from there we'll see whether or not you will require another admission.\n\nP: Sure. \n\nD: OK, and there you might, I'm not 100% sure, but you might require home oxygen if like we take your vitals and everything and your oxygenation is very low. Have you have you been talked about that at all in the past?\n\nP: Yeah, they talked about it last time I've been trying to avoid it, but if it has to happen, it has to happen.\n\nD: Hmm yeah, and it might just sometimes just, you know you've had four admissions in the past and it might actually just help you stay at home if you are on oxygen. Anyways, yeah we can talk about that. We'll do like a full physical examination everything and go from there.\n\nP: Sure. \n\nD: Great, I'll be with you shortly.\n",
