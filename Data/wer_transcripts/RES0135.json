And also, um, these symptoms do overlap with COVID as well, um, and so it'll be important to get a COVID swab just in case. Um, but um, if that is the, the scenario, then it will be um, supportive care with oxygen, fluids and we'll make sure that um, that her, her breathing is uh, okay. And possibly, we'll need steroids and um, and uh, an inhaler if necessary. \n\nP: Okay. Okay, that sounds good, thank you.",
