Um I also tried a cough syrup, um it didn't, it helped for a couple hours, but then it was back again. The cough was back again. \n\nD: OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?\n\nP: Uh well, I I said yeah when I get a cold.\n\nD: Mhmm, OK.\n\nP: Once a year maybe.\n\nD: Once a year?

And I'm sorry when did your constipation start?\n\nP: Oh it's a problem for years. I don't eat enough fibre.\n\nD: Oh, OK. Any changes in your urine?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, any nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: No, OK. Any joint pain? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, numbness or tingling? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Headaches?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, OK. Are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding medical conditions? \n\nP: I have diabetes.\n\nD: OK, how long have you had diabetes?\n\nP: It's about, it's been uh seven years now.\n\nD: OK, any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK and um how about medications? Are you on any? \n\nP: Uh yeah, I've been taking uh metformin for the past uh, for the past five years, when, five or six years.\n\nD: OK. \n\nP: Um and uh my family Doc started me on uh ramipril about two weeks ago, he told me that uh now that I'm 50, I need to I need to be on this pill as well, so now I have to take 2 pills instead of one.\n\nD: OK. \n\nP: Yeah because I think it's it's good for my heart or something.\n\nD: Yeah, for sure. So you started that two weeks ago, OK. Are you up to date with all your immunizations? \n\nP: Uh yeah, I think so.\n\nD: OK, any allergies?\n\nP: Uhm penicillin, I just get uh I get a rash. I got a rash when I was a child, I haven't had it since then.\n\nD: OK, OK. Any family history of lung or heart conditions? \n\nP: Uh no, nothing like that.\n\nD: No, OK.

Uhm, any travel recently?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, OK. And where do you live right now?\n\nP: I live in a house with my wife and my two kids. \n\nD: OK, uh are they healthy?\n\nP: Yeah, they're all healthy.\n\nD: OK. Any old carpet, dust, mold, or asbestos in your home? \n\nP: Um not that I'm aware of.\n\nD: No, OK. OK, well it seems like um those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?\n\nP: Uh no, I just want to get tested for Covid. \n\nD: Yeah, so we will definitely do a Covid swab on you because you have a cough, um and those results should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours, and so you'll know more then. But because your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid, we still recommend isolating for 14 days. But the other thing I want to mention is that you don't have any other symptoms of infection besides your cough, and it seems like the cough started a week ago and you started this new medication ramipril two weeks ago, and so ramipril is a type of ACE inhibitor and one of its side effects is that in some people it can cause coughing. So, I am going to review your medications and if your family Doc also agrees, we may try uh another um blood pressure medication for you instead of ramipril.\n\nP: Sure. \n\nD: Um so we'll try and change that medication and see if your coughing stops. How does that sound? \n\nP: Sounds great.\n\nD: OK, great, thank you.",
