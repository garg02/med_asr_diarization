I just feels like I can't, can't ah, catch my breath.\n\nD: OK, so is it mostly related to your breathing or do you have it at rest? Or do you have it with any exertion?\n\nP: Yeah, I think it, it's there kind of most of the time, like the chest pressure. I kind of feel it throughout my chest when when I'm breathing but, but also just kind of sitting here I can kind of feel it.\n\nD: OK I see. And are all of your symptoms constant? Or do they come and go?\n\nP: They've been constant and they've got been getting worse since since last night. \n\nD: OK, and have you had this happen to you before?\n\nP: It has, yeah, I, actually last last winter I was hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation for, for a few days. I I know I got some antibiotics and umm, I needed some oxygen.\n\nD: I see and did you go home on home oxygen at all? Like do you use oxygen at home?\n\nP: No, I was told I didn't need any any yet, but if I didn't quit smoking I might in the future. \n\nD: OK, and are you using any kind of puffers at all?\n\nP: Yeah, I I do I I use I think it's called like Spiriva or something like that. I use that every day and there's another one that I'll use like if my symptoms are getting bad. My blue one. I did try that actually last night and it didn't, it helped a little bit, but, not not enough.\n\nD: OK, so have you just tried like tried it one time last night? Have you tried it after that?\n\nP: Yeah, we just tried it last night.\n\nD: OK, so nothing today right?\n\nP: No, nothing today. \n\nD: OK. Other than that, so you did have an admission before for this. And you have COPD. Do you have any other symptoms right now? Like runny nose, sore throat, any cold like symptoms?\n\nP: No, no, I I I don't.\n\nD: Did you have it before these symptoms started? \n\nP: Uhm no, I've been feeling, I've been feeling OK.\n\nD: OK. And have you traveled at all recently?\n\nP: Uh, well, I did, I just go up to the trailer not too long ago to visit some family, but that's just an hour away.\n\nD: OK. Anyone sick around you recently?\n\nP: No, I don't, I don't think so.\n\nD: And is there, are you having any headache or nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: No, I haven't had anything like that. \n\nD: OK. And besides the time you got hospitalized, have you had any exacerbations after that?\n\nP: No, I just had that, had that happen, the one time, last year.\n\nD: OK. And do you feel that your symptoms are similar, worse, or how do they compare to last time, if you remember?\n\nP: Pretty similar. I think last time I was worse, but I waited longer last time and so that's why I was concerned and and wanted to come in early.\n\nD: OK. OK, uh, alright, so uh, have you had any fevers at all or chills?\n\nP: Yeah, I've I've had some chills last night like I just couldn't get warm.

Do you feel that you're breathing faster at all?\n\nP: Uh, not necessarily it, just it just harder to to, feel like I can't catch my breath.\n\nD: OK, do you feel fatigued at all?\n\nP: Ah yeah, I I have a, I mean I have been feeling just tired this morning, but I think that's more to do with the fact that I just can't really do a whole lot of exertion because as soon as I move around I'm, I can't breathe.\n\nD: I see. Uhm OK, and are you having any kind of diarrhea, constipation, or any urinary troubles at all?\n\nP: No, I'm not.\n\nD: OK.

    "ref_norm": "so what brings you in today yeah i have had i have had a cough for a number of years now but store these past like day it is gotten a lot quite a bit worse and i have been really short of breath ok and so how many days would you say you have been short of breath less than a day maybe just really kind of started last night and has carried out throughout this morning i i called this morning to get an appointment ok and it was it brought on by any activities or were you doing anything at that time before it started no last last night i was well i was just doing my regular kind of routine after dinner cleaning up and just the cough started 1st and over the over the night it got worse i could just could not catch my breath and that was similar this morning ok so you have also had a cough yeah i have yeah i have had a cough for a long time now but it has been worse over this last day yeah is it like a wet cough or dry cough it is wet i i am bring up sputum most of the time but it has been it is usually like white or clear and it is a lot more like it is a lot more greenish yellow and yeah ok and are you having any kind of fevers or chills anything like that uhm yeah i i did have some chills last night so i am not sure about a fever though ok and are your symptoms at all so you do have a shortness of breath but any kind of chest pain at all i do have some chest pressure for sure i just feels like i can not can not ah catch my breath ok so is it mostly related to your breathing or do you have it at rest or do you have it with any exertion yeah i think it it is there kind of most of the time like the chest pressure i kind of feel it throughout my chest when when i am breathing but but also just kind of sitting here i can kind of feel it ok i see and are all of your symptoms constant or do they come and go they have been constant and they have got been getting worse since since last night ok and have you had this happen to you before it has yeah i actually last last winter i was hospitalized for a copd exacerbation for for a few days i i know i got some antibiotics and umm i needed some oxygen i see and did you go home on home oxygen at all like do you use oxygen at home no i was told i did not need any any yet but if i did not quit smoking i might in the future ok and are you using any kind of puffers at all yeah i i do i i use i think it is called like spiriva or something like that i use that every day and there is another one that i will use like if my symptoms are getting bad my blue one i did try that actually last night and it did not it helped a little bit but not not enough ok so have you just tried like tried it one time last night have you tried it after that yeah we just tried it last night ok so nothing today right no nothing today ok other than that so you did have an admission before for this and you have copd do you have any other symptoms right now like runny nose sore throat any cold like symptoms no no i i i do not did you have it before these symptoms started uhm no i have been feeling i have been feeling ok ok and have you traveled at all recently well i did i just go up to the trailer not too long ago to visit some family but that is just an hour away ok anyone sick around you recently no i do not i do not think so and is there are you having any headache or nausea or vomiting no i have not had anything like that ok and besides the time you got hospitalized have you had any exacerbations after that no i just had that had that happen the one time last year ok and do you feel that your symptoms are similar worse or how do they compare to last time if you remember pretty similar i think last time i was worse but i waited longer last time and so that is why i was concerned and and wanted to come in early ok ok alright so have you had any fevers at all or chills yeah i have i have had some chills last night like i just could not get warm i was loading up on blankets and it did not seem to help ok so we will get a temperature on you today as well do you feel that you are breathing faster at all not necessarily it just it just harder to to feel like i can not catch my breath ok do you feel fatigued at all ah yeah i i have a i mean i have been feeling just tired this morning but i think that is more to do with the fact that i just can not really do a whole lot of exertion because as soon as i move around i am i can not breathe i see uhm ok and are you having any kind of diarrhea constipation or any urinary troubles at all no i am not ok any changes in your sleep or appetite that has been that has been normal been eating well ok any kind of confusion or any do you feel like yourself yeah i do ok any confusion at all that anyone is noticed no i do not think so i feel like that has been ok any wheezing yeah i i have noticed some wheezing it is usually i usually well i have been told i have a wheeze but i can actually hear it right now ok yeah we will do like a full physical examination as well and we will get like your oxygenation level and everything like that umm do you have any besides copd so when were you diagnosed with you please about 10 years ago ok do you have any other medical conditions i do yeah i have a high blood pressure type 2 diabetes and like and there is something wrong with my with my kidneys as well i think my egfr is low or something like that 0 i see ok and do you take any medications besides your puffers yeah i i do i i take on an ace inhibitor metformin sglt 2 inhibitor and i am also taking a a water pill as well cause i over these last couple of years i have had some more swelling in my in my feet ok i see do you have any swelling increased swelling right now no i that has been about this been pretty constant ok and do you feel recently at all that you are short of breath when lying down or do you have to wake up to take a deep breath anything like that no i have not only brought issues like that ok any any kind of dizziness or fainting episodes no i have not had anything like that ok any increased sweating associated with your chest tight or pressure or anything like that no no i have not been sweaty ok yeah and other than that any previous surgeries in the past uhm i yeah i had a uterine prolapse so i had surgery for that i have 5 kids ok any any complications after that surgery at all no
