Um, have you ever been hospitalized or have you had any surgeries in the past?\n\nP: Uh, like when I was first diagnosed with Crohn's maybe 20 years ago, when I was like 20, I was in the hospital for a little bit 'cause I was really dehydrated and I couldn't really like, I just couldn't I wasn't feeling well at that time, but since then I've been pretty on top of it.\n\nD: OK, that's good to hear.
