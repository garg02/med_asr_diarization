Or have you or do you have any joint swelling?\n\nP: Uh I have some joint um swelling. It's it's not very visible, but it's it appears slightly more swollen than my left, sorry, than my right knee.\n\nD: OK. So just a little bit of swelling in your left knee, but no other joints?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, um and have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?\n\nP: Um I have um diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. And I'm overweight.\n\nD: OK, do you take any medications for any of those conditions?\n\nP: I'm on insulin for diabetes.

Um and is there any, uh, like musculoskeletal or like autoimmune conditions that run in the family?\n\nP: Uhm no musculoskeletal issues uh that, I know diabetes runs in the family.\n\nD: OK, um alright, so that was everything I wanted to ask on history. So next I just wanted to do a physical exam, and just looking at the left knee, are you seeing any um swelling or redness uh on the knee?\n\nP: Um it appears slightly more swollen than my right knee. \n\nD: OK, but are you seeing any redness?\n\nP: No redness.\n\nD: OK, and are there any temperature changes? Like does the knee feel hot or or warm?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, and if you um press along the uh joint line, do you feel any pain? \n\nP: Uhm yeah, it feels a little tender. \n\nD: OK. And how about pain over any of the muscles, like the thigh muscles or the hamstrings or the calf muscles?\n\nP: No, those are fine.\n\nD: OK, and then how about any pain over the patella or kneecap?\n\nP: That that's a little bit more painful.\n\nD: OK, and are you able to bend your knee uh like like flex it, straighten it?\n\nP: Uh I can do that, it's just painful when I do that. \n\nD: OK. Um and uh and then how about walking, are you um, do you have an antalgic gait or or or a limp?\n\nP: Uhm no, no, well, I guess I'm I'm putting more weight on my right knee so it might appear to some people that I do have a slight limp.\n\nD: OK. And any issues with moving your hip or your ankle?\n\nP: Uh no.\n\nD: OK, um so I think that was everything I wanted to ask and check today. Did did you have any questions?\n\nP: Um yeah, so um how do you, how can I treat my knee?\n\nD: Yeah, certainly, so it it sounds like um this could be most likely osteoarthritis um of the left knee, which uh is something that would be best treated with uh trying to stay as active as you can, but but also pacing your activities as well, so that you're not um doing so much that the next day you're in significant amount of pain, but it's important to remember that um activity will help um with keeping your knee mobile, but also um actually help with reducing pain as well, and then also uh you could use Tylenol um as a medication for it. I wouldn't recommend ibuprofen or NSAIDs on a long term basis, although you could take those if you're having like an acute flare up of your pain. Um and then also like topical agents such as um like Voltaren or something like that you could put on your knee and um if it's really bad and it keeps um continuing on, we can consider something like a steroid injection as well.\n\nP: OK, yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. \n\nD: Alright, thank you.",

could you tell me a little bit about your living situation currently like like who you are living with and whereabouts i live with my husband in a house downtown ok and are you working currently no i retired early ok do you drink alcohol i will have a glass of wine every night ok so about 7 drinks per week yes ok and do you smoke cigarettes no i do not alright how about the use of any recreational drugs like cannabis or or anything else no alright and is there any like musculoskeletal or like autoimmune conditions that run in the family uhm no musculoskeletal issues that i know diabetes runs in the family ok alright so that was everything i wanted to ask on history so next i just wanted to do a physical exam and just looking at the left knee are you seeing any swelling or redness on the knee it appears slightly more swollen than my right knee ok but are you seeing any redness no redness ok and are there any temperature changes like does the knee feel hot or or warm no ok and if you press along the joint line do you feel any pain uhm yeah it feels a little tender ok and how about pain over any of the muscles like the thigh muscles or the hamstrings or the calf muscles no those are fine ok and then how about any pain over the patella or kneecap that that is a little bit more painful ok and are you able to bend your knee like like flex it straighten it i can do that it is just painful when i do that ok and and then how about walking are you do you have an antalgic gait or or or a limp uhm no no well i guess i am i am putting more weight on my right knee so it might appear to some people that i do have a slight limp ok and any issues with moving your hip or your ankle no ok so i think that was everything i wanted to ask and check today did did you have any questions yeah so how do you how can i treat my knee yeah certainly so it it sounds like this could be most likely osteoarthritis of the left knee which is something that would be best treated with trying to stay as active as you can but but also pacing your activities as well so that you are not doing so much that the next day you are in significant amount of pain but it is important to remember that activity will help with keeping your knee mobile but also actually help with reducing pain as well and then also you could use tylenol as a medication for it i would not recommend ibuprofen or nsaids on a long term basis although you could take those if you are having like an acute flare up of your pain and then also like topical agents such as like voltaren or something like that you could put on your knee and if it is really bad and it keeps continuing on we can consider something like a steroid injection as well ok yeah that sounds good thank you alright thank you",
