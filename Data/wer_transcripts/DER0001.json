    "ref": "P: Hey Doc, I'm a 45 year old man coming in, I'm worried there's a little old rash on my leg that I'm getting nervous about.\n\nD: Hi, so you I understand you have a rash on your leg.\n\nP: I don't really know what I would call it. That's what I told the nurse when I came in, but it more hurts than anything.\n\nD: OK, uh, how long is this been going on for?\n\nP: Ah, it's been it's been looking weird for about a week, but only yes, it started hurting yesterday and started looking strange and I just wanted to come in to get it checked out.\n\nD: OK when you say it's looking strange, can you tell me what you mean by that?\n\nP: Swollen, it looks bigger than it did before, and meaner, if that makes sense.\n\nD: Swollen OK, is it red?\n\nP: Yeah, it's red, it's turning more red, kind of in the area around it. I've got these I got these scabs. I've got diabetes and I'm not exactly the best with it and scratching at it, and normally it's not that bad, but this is just strange looking and there's no other word for it. \n\nD: OK, have you ever had anything like this before? I guess you kinda just said that you didn't, but I'll just double check.\n\nP: No no. Well I've had,  I have occasional ulcers and sometimes I have banged my toe when I'm not exactly the best taking care of my feet, but this is the first time I've gotten something that I don't know, I've just never seen it before.\n\nD: Do you have any ulcers right now?\n\nP: Let me see. I think so, when's the last time I saw the family doc? I think I've got an ulcer on my left heel, but I think it's doing alright.\n\nD: OK, and what leg are you having this problem with?\n\nP: Right now it's on my right, so my ankle.\n\nD: OK, how have your sugars been controlled recently? \n\nP: I stopped measuring them. Yeah, last time I measured it was pretty bad. I think my A1C last time was like 9 something. I'm trying, I'm trying better to be with it. It's hard with work you know?\n\nD: For sure, I can imagine so, in general, even if you don't know your numbers for your sugars, have you felt worse than usual lately? Have you felt rundown at all?\n\nP: Yeah, actually I have gained more, feel hungry, sometimes just tired, but it's hard to tell. There's an awful lot going on in my life right now with the kids, but, It's hard to tell I think. Yeah, I need to see my family doc.\n\nD: OK. Definitely you know a good a good idea moving forward just to make sure you get on top of these things, but I'm glad you came in today so we can, you know, have a better look at you and make sure that there's nothing super concerning going on. So in addition to this, have you had any other new symptoms?\n\nP: Symptoms? Um, I feel a little hot actually. When the swelling started it's it also started leaking this like white stuff from one of the one of what used to be a scab so now like kind of an open wound now.\n\nD: OK, OK so when did you start feeling hot?\n\nP: Honestly, last 12 hours.\n\nD: OK, you take your temperature at all?\n\nP: No, I don't have a thermometer at home.\n\nD: Have you had any difficulty breathing?\n\nP: No no. \n\nD: Any chest pain?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Have you noticed that your left, sorry, your right leg feels any hotter than the left?\n\nP: Yeah, yeah it does. Actually changing socks the other day, yeah.\n\nD: Right. Say, have you alone have you felt ill recently? Have you been sick at all?\n\nP: Aside from just feeling overall crummy last couple weeks, no don't really, less energy today, but I was up last night thinking about this and yeah wanted to come in and talk.\n\nD: OK yeah, you did the right thing. I'm glad that you're in today. Is the pain on your legs worse when you touch it?\n\nP: Yeah, maybe not so much when I touch it. When I walk with it and I start flexing it it, it doesn't like that. \n\nD: OK, uhm. \n\nP: Just resting it right now, it feels fine. \n\nD: It's OK, OK. OK, well I'm going to if I think of any more questions specifically about your leg I will, I'll go back to it, but I'm going to just move on and ask you questions about your overall health. You've already shared with me that you you are diabetic. Do you have any other chronic conditions that you live with?\n\nP: Chronic condition? I see the family doc about cholesterol. I'm on a pill for that. Uhm, I had asthma as a kid, not too much of an issue now. And my back, I've had back pain for the last 10 years, but all I really take for it is Tylenol Advil for that.\n\nD: OK, oh my other question about your leg was, have you lost any feeling in it?\n\nP: It kind of is like a dull ache sometimes when I touch it. But, no like,  in the area, the ankle no, but definitely on my feet, like over the years I've noticed I feel less on it compared to what I did previously, yeah.\n\nD: OK, so sorry I kind of sidetracked there so we talked about your diabetes. You said you have high cholesterol. So what medications are you currently taking?\n\nP: I'm taking 4 pills right now. One of them is for the cholesterol. I think it's called. rosuvastatin. The other three, they're all diabetes medications, but I don't remember. Metformin is one of them. Sidas...something I have a list somewhere. I'll give it to you later.\n\nD: OK, are you on insulin right now?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Are you on any or any of these medications new to you, recently? \n\nP: No no, but had them for about a year now.\n\nD: Do you have any allergies?\n\nP: Um, yeah, I do actually. Penicillin, can't take that.\n\nD: And what happens when you take penicillin?\n\nP: It's been a while, as a kid apparently like my face got bloated and I was having a hard time breathing so...\n\nD: Well, we will make sure that we don't give you that. Can you tell me if you've had any previous surgery? \n\nP: Oh yeah, uh, what was it? I had my sinuses, had some pretty bad sinusitis when I was in my teens and they went in and kind of carved a little space out. \n\nD: OK, OK. Is that the only surgery that you had? \n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: And can you tell me, do you have any family history of diabetes, skin problems, anything else that stands out to you?\n\nP: Yep, mom's side of the family, very much everyone has diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol. Dad's side of the the family is pretty healthy. I think maybe one of my aunts had lung cancer, but she's a pretty big smoker too.\n\nD: And then just ask you a few questions about your lifestyle. So you said that you have children.\n\nP: Yeah, I do. \n\nD: Do you live in town? Do you live with your kids?\n\nP: I live in town. I see my kids every two weeks.\n\nD: And, uh. What do you do for work? Did I already ask you this?\n\nP: No, I'm currently unemployed and looking for work, partially employed, I suppose we should say I have my own business.\n\nD: I see and, what do you, what do you do when when you are working, ideally?\n\nP: When I am working, I'm an accountant.\n\nD: OK well, and do you smoke?\n\nP: Yeah once in a while, yeah, when I'm stressed. \n\nD: How much do you smoke on average?\n\nP: Last couple of weeks, I've been smoking more, maybe like 2 packs a week.\n\nD: OK. Do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: Yeah yeah.\n\nD: How much do you typically drink?\n\nP: Average week, maybe a 2 4.\n\nD: So maybe like 3 per day or something like that if you were to average it out?\n\nP: Yeah, if you average out I mainly go through the two four in a weekend to be honest. \n\nD: Oh, I see. OK, more so on the weekend, so maybe a little bit more than three per day on those days?\n\nP: Mhm.\n\nD: OK so that that that's everything that I need to ask you for now. I'd like to get a closer look at this leg. Did you have any other questions or concerns before we move forward to the physical exam?\n\nP: No I just want to get this figured out.\n\nD: OK, yeah, we will definitely do that for you. So yeah, I'm going to have a look at it and then after that I will go talk to the doctor that I'm working with and we'll see what we can do for you. That sounds good?\n\nP: Thank you doc, yeah sounds great.\n\nD: Awesome OK thanks.",

had anything like this before i guess you kinda just said that you did not but i will just double check no no well i have had i have occasional ulcers and sometimes i have banged my toe when i am not exactly the best taking care of my feet but this is the 1st time i have gotten something that i do not know i have just never seen it before do you have any ulcers right now let me see i think so when is the last time i saw the family doc i think i have got an ulcer on my left heel but i think it is doing alright ok and what leg are you having this problem with right now it is on my right so my ankle ok how have your sugars been controlled recently i stopped measuring them yeah last time i measured it was pretty bad i think my a one c last time was like 9 something i am trying i am trying better to be with it it is hard with work you know for sure i can imagine so in general even if you do not know your numbers for your sugars have you felt worse than usual lately have you felt rundown at all yeah actually i have gained more feel hungry sometimes just tired but it is hard to tell there is an awful lot going on in my life right now with the kids but it is hard to tell i think yeah i need to see my family doc ok definitely you know a good a good idea moving forward just to make sure you get on top of these things but i am glad you came in today so we can you know have a better look at you and make sure that there is nothing super concerning going on so in addition to this have you had any other new symptoms symptoms i feel a little hot actually when the swelling started it is it also started leaking this like white stuff from one of the one of what used to be a scab so now like kind of an open wound now ok ok so when did you start feeling hot honestly last 12 hours ok you take your temperature at all no i do not have a thermometer at home have you had any difficulty breathing no no any chest pain no have you noticed that your left sorry your right leg feels any hotter than the left yeah yeah it does actually changing socks the other day yeah right say have you alone have you felt ill recently have you been sick at all aside from just feeling overall crummy last couple weeks no do not really less energy today but i was up last night thinking about this and yeah wanted to come in and talk ok yeah you did the right thing i am glad that you are in today is the pain on your legs worse when you touch it yeah maybe not so much when i touch it when i walk with it and i start flexing it it it does not like that ok uhm just resting it right now it feels fine it is ok ok ok well i am going to if i think of any more questions specifically about your leg i will i will go back to it but i am going to just move on and ask you questions about your overall health you have already shared with me that you you are diabetic do you have any other chronic conditions that you live with chronic condition i see the family doc about cholesterol i am on a pill for that uhm i had asthma as a kid not too much of an issue now and my back i have had back pain for the last 10 years but all i really take for it is tylenol advil for that ok 0 my other question about your leg was have you lost any feeling in it it kind of is like a dull ache sometimes when i touch it but no like in the area the ankle no but definitely on my feet like over the years i have noticed i feel less on it compared to what i did previously yeah ok so sorry i kind of sidetracked there so we talked about your diabetes you said you have high cholesterol so what medications are you currently taking i am taking 4 pills right now one of them is for the cholesterol i think it is called rosuvastatin the other 3 they are all diabetes medications but i do not remember metformin is one of them sidas something i have a list somewhere i will give it to you later ok are you on insulin right now no are you on any or any of these medications new to you recently no no but had them for about a year now do you have any allergies yeah i do actually penicillin can not take that and what happens when you take penicillin it has been a while as a kid apparently like my face got bloated and i was having a hard time breathing so . well we will make sure that we do not give you that can you tell me if you have had any previous surgery 0 yeah what was it i had my sinuses had some pretty bad sinusitis when i was in my teens and they went in and kind of carved a little space out ok ok is that the only surgery that you had yeah and can you tell me do you have any family history of diabetes skin problems anything else that stands out to you yep mom is side of the family very much everyone has diabetes high blood pressure cholesterol dad is side of the the family is pretty healthy i think maybe one of my aunts had lung cancer but she is a pretty big smoker too and then just ask you a few questions about your lifestyle so you said that you have children yeah i do do you live in town do you live with your kids i live in town i see my kids every 2 weeks and what do you do for work did i already ask you this no i am currently unemployed and looking for work partially employed i suppose we should say i have my own business i see and what do you what do you do when when you are working ideally when i am working i am an accountant ok well and do you smoke yeah once in a while yeah when i am stressed how much do you smoke on average last couple of weeks i have been smoking more maybe like 2 packs a week ok do you drink alcohol yeah yeah how much do you typically drink average week maybe a 2 4 so maybe like 3 per day or something like that if you were to average it out yeah if you average out i mainly go through the 24 in a weekend to be honest 0 i see ok more so on the weekend so maybe a little bit more than 3 per day on those days ok so that that that is everything that i need to ask you for now i would like to get a closer look at this leg did you have any other questions or concerns before we move forward to the physical exam no i just want to get this figured out ok yeah we will definitely do that for you so yeah i am going to have a look at it
