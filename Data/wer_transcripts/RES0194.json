sometimes like but that that is that is about it maybe like 3 or 4 beers a week alright ok so yeah those are all the questions i had for you today do you have any questions at all yeah i was just worried that it could be covid with how everything is going on and that is just sort of what i was wondering about today yeah so that is something we definitely want to rule out your symptoms definitely overlap with the cluster of symptoms that someone may get with covid so we will do a swab on you today and recommend that you isolate for 2 weeks until your symptoms have gone and the test result you will get you will get back in the next 24 to 48 hours and alongside your test results so you will also get further instructions from public health about whether or not you need another swab later on and when to return to work ok that yeah that sounds good thank you yeah no worries and it can definitely also be another viral infection as well even if it is not covid in which case it just you just need to get some rest stay hydrated and let it take its course ok now that sounds that sounds good so it could be covid or like another viral illness yeah ok thank you welcome take care take
