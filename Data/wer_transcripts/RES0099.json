Uhm, is the headache on one side or, or the other or on both sides?\n\nP: I think it's like both sides.\n\nD: And is the headache like pulsating or is it more, continuous kind of constant pain?\n\nP: I think it's more continuous constant.\n\nD: Alright, and have you had any sensitivity to light or sound that, that's made the headache a lot worse?\n\nP: No, it's, it's kind of just there, it's about the same as when it was when it started.\n\nD: OK, have you had any nausea and vomiting associated with that, the headache or anything else?\n\nP: Uh, no.\n\nD: OK. And so, and then, last question for the headache piece. Does it feel like it was a like kind of sudden onset, worst headache of your life sensation?\n\nP: Uh, no, it's still like, like I can still cope with it, like, if I wanted to I would have gone into work. But it was the muscle aches that really started bothering me.\n\nD: OK. And so you had a cough as well, when did this start, and is it a dry or wet cough?\n\nP: It's a dry cough and it started yesterday, probably in the morning when I woke up.\n\nD: OK, and has the cough been getting any better or worse?\n\nP: Uhm, since yesterday I would sayit's probably a bit worse now.\n\nD: Alright, and it's dry, but have you seen any blood that's come up?\n\nP: No, no, no blood.\n\nD: And have you had any shortness of breath?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK.

It's mainly just like in, I would say in around my upper back like my upper arms and kind of like my thighs and glutes areas \n\nD: OK. And how has your energy been these last couple of days?\n\nP: Yesterday I felt a bit drained. I just kind of like stayed in bed the whole day.\n\nD: OK, and have you tried any medications for the, for the headache or any of your symptoms so far?\n\nP: I, I took a Tylenol. I actually took a couple Tylenols, uh, when the headache and pain started. It did help a bit for a couple hours, but it just kind of came back. \n\nD: OK. And in the past, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?\n\nP: Uhm, Just uh, like I had type 2 diabetes, that's it. \n\nD: OK, and are you using medications for your diabetes?\n\nP: Yeah, I've been on Metformin.\n\nD: OK, have you used insulin before?\n\nP: No, no, I've never had to use insulin. It's pretty stable, like my family doctors even considering taking me off the metformin.\n\nD: OK, no, that's great. And that reminds me, actually, how has your weight been over the last several months? Have you had any weight changes?\n\nP: Not really, like I, I, I think over the last two years I've just been very focused on my fitness, so I feel like I've probably lost around 30 pounds over the last year. Last one to two, yeah, year, but like I, I've been exercising a lot like uhm, gym every day, it's, it's been, it's been a journey. \n\nD: no that's great though, good for you. I encourage you to keep that up for sure. OK, and so do you take any other medications, other, over the counter or prescribed?\n\nP: Uhm, just a multi vitamins. \n\nD: Alright, and do you have any allergies to medications?\n\nP: No, not that I know of.\n\nD: All right. So have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: Alright, and uh, anybody in the family have any like lung conditions, heart conditions or diseases that run in the family?\n\nP: Uh, my, my son actually just recently was diagnosed with asthma. But I think that he gets that from his mom's side. \n\nD: OK. Uhm, you don't have any asthma or problems breathing like that?\n\nP: No, nothing like that. \n\nD: OK, and right now, so you mentioned your son and wife, is that who you're living with?\n\nP: Yeah, it's just us three. \n\nD: OK, and uh, any exposures to, to anybody who's been sick, either at home or at work or, or any other activities?\n\nP:  Uh, unfortunately I do have to, uh, I'm one of the unlucky ones that still has to go into work. And yeah, it's it's hard to say like at work, there are times when we, like at lunch we eat like without a mask. I don't know if, I didn't notice anyone having any symptoms, but like, I don't know if someone, you know, who knows where anyone has been.\n\nD: Yeah, so nobody that you're aware of who's been sick though?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: And everybody at home has been OK?\n\nP: Yeah, at home everyone's good. I kind of just distance myself into like one room.\n\nD: Mhm.\n\nP: Just in case anything goes wrong.\n\nD: OK. And have you traveled anywhere?\n\nP: No, we've been, we've been at home this whole time.\n\nD: OK. And do you smoke cigarettes?\n\nP: No, I've never smoked.\n\nD: OK, so do you, do you smoke marijuana?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Alright and you use any other recreational drugs like cocaine, opioids, heroin? And how, have you used anything like that in the past?\n\nP: No. Never.\n\nD: OK, uhm, and do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: Yeah, well just occasionally, like I would say maybe, maybe some wine, once, uh, like once every couple days. Maybe a beer on the weekend, but that's it. \n\nD: Alright. So I think that was all I wanted to ask on history today. Was there anything else that, that you wanted to add before we go on to the exam and?\n\nP: Yeah, so I, I, I don't know if I should get a test done, like for covid. Uhm yeah, that's all, just wondering if I, if I can do that here?\n\nD: Yeah, so that is something that that is on the differential for what could be causing your symptoms, especially with uhm, starting at having a cough and the nonspecific viral type symptoms with the cough, headache, muscle aches, so certainly could be caused by covid, but there are other reasons for, that could explain these symptoms, such as other types of viral illnesses, and so we will do a PCR swab today, as well as do, well, check your vitals to see if you have a fever now and we'll also maybe send an influenza swab as well, and and do some blood work. But in the meantime, since we're running the covid swab, it will be important to self isolate for the next 14 days and we will let you know what the test results show. But despite, even if they are negative, it will be important to still stay self isolating for the next 14 days.\n\nP: OK, I'll do that. That sounds good.\n\nD: Alright, thank you.",

in there ok have you had headaches like this before no not really ok uhm is the headache on one side or or the other or on both sides i think it is like both sides and is the headache like pulsating or is it more continuous kind of constant pain i think it is more continuous constant alright and have you had any sensitivity to light or sound that that is made the headache a lot worse no it is it is kind of just there it is about the same as when it was when it started ok have you had any nausea and vomiting associated with that the headache or anything else no ok and so and then last question for the headache piece does it feel like it was a like kind of sudden onset worst headache of your life sensation no it is still like like i can still cope with it like if i wanted to i would have gone into work but it was the muscle aches that really started bothering me ok and so you had a cough as well when did this start and is it a dry or wet cough it is a dry cough and it started yesterday probably in the morning when i woke up ok and has the cough been getting any better or worse uhm since yesterday i would sayit is probably a bit worse now alright and it is dry but have you seen any blood that is come up no no no blood and have you had any shortness of breath no ok and have you had any flu like symptoms or infectious symptoms like a red eyes runny eyes runny nose or a sore throat no i do not have any of those symptoms ok you mentioned you felt feverish do you feel hot now not right now but i did have last night just was just very chilly and i had to just wrap myself up in a couple blankets ok did you have any night sweats no i i did not have any night sweats alright and have you had any chest pain no no chest pain alright so how about any dizziness or lightheadedness nope ok and have you had any wheeze no wheezing ok uhm and have you noticed any swelling to any of your extremities like your ankles no nope ok and have you had any belly pain no belly pain any urinary problems like pain or or frequency going to the bathroom no and any diarrhea no diarrhea alright and have you noticed any rashes or or changes to your skin no not at all alright and i do not know you have had muscle aches have you had any joint pains no no musc sorry no joint pain it is mainly just like in i would say in around my upper back like my upper arms and kind of like my thighs and glutes areas ok and how has your energy been these last couple of days yesterday i felt a bit drained i just kind of like stayed in bed the whole day ok and have you tried any medications for the for the headache or any of your symptoms so far i i took a tylenol i actually took a couple tylenols when the headache and pain started it did help a bit for a couple hours but it just kind of came back ok and in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions uhm just like i had type 2 diabetes that is it ok and are you using medications for your diabetes yeah i have been on metformin ok have you used insulin before no no i have never had to use insulin it is pretty stable like my family doctors even considering taking me off the metformin ok no that is great and that reminds me actually how has your weight been over the last several months have you had any weight changes not really like i i i think over the last 2 years i have just been very focused on my fitness so i feel like i have probably lost around \u00a330 over the last year last one to 2 yeah year but like i i have been exercising a lot like uhm gym every day it is it has been it has been a journey no that is great though good for you i encourage you to keep that up for sure ok and so do you take any other medications other over the counter or prescribed uhm just a multi vitamins alright and do you have any allergies to medications no not that i know of all right so have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries no alright and anybody in the family have any like lung conditions heart conditions or diseases that run in the family my my son actually just recently was diagnosed with asthma but i think that he gets that from his mom is side ok uhm you do not have any asthma or problems breathing like that no nothing like that ok and right now so you mentioned your son and wife is that who you are living with yeah it is just us 3 ok and any exposures to to anybody who has been sick either at home or at work or or any other activities unfortunately i do have to i am one of the unlucky ones that still has to go into work and yeah it is it is hard to say like at work there are times when we like at lunch we eat like without a mask i do not know if i did not notice anyone having any symptoms but like i do not know if someone you know who knows where anyone has been yeah so nobody that you are aware of who has been sick though no and everybody at home has been ok yeah at home everyone is good i kind of just distance myself into like one room just in case anything goes wrong ok and have you traveled anywhere no we have been we have been at home this whole time ok and do you smoke cigarettes no i have never smoked ok so do you do you smoke marijuana no alright and you use any other recreational drugs like cocaine opioids heroin and how have you used anything like that in the past no never ok uhm and do you drink alcohol yeah well just occasionally like i would say maybe maybe some wine once like once every couple days maybe a beer on the weekend but that is it alright so i think that was all i wanted to ask on history today was there anything else that that you wanted to add before we go on to the exam and yeah so i i i do not know if i should get a test done like for covid uhm yeah that is all just wondering if i if i can do that here yeah so that is something that that is on the differential for what could be causing your symptoms especially with uhm starting at having a cough and the nonspecific viral type symptoms with the cough headache muscle aches so certainly could be caused by covid but there are other reasons for that could explain these symptoms such as other types of viral illnesses and so we will do a pcr swab today as well as do well check your vitals to see if you have a fever now and we will also maybe send an influenza swab as well and and do some blood work but in the meantime since we are running the covid swab it will be important to self isolate for the next 14 days and we will let you know what the test results show but despite even if they are negative it will be important to still stay self isolating for the next 14 days ok i will do that that sounds good alright thank you",
    "ref_norm_d": "umm how may i help you ok so just to confirm so the the symptoms at 1st started with a headache and and fatigue and that started 2 days ago ok and any particular muscles that were achy or is this more of a uhm general kind of whole body feeling ok and in terms of the headache could you describe uhm could you describe the headache ok have you had headaches like this before ok uhm is the headache on one side or or the other or on both sides and is the headache like pulsating or is it more continuous kind of constant pain alright and have you had any sensitivity to light or sound that that is made the headache a lot worse ok have you had any nausea and vomiting associated with that the headache or anything else ok and so and then last question for the headache piece does it feel like it was a like kind of sudden onset worst headache of your life sensation ok and so you had a cough as well when did this start and is it a dry or wet cough ok and has the cough been getting any better or worse alright and it is dry but have you seen any blood that is come up and have you had any shortness of breath ok and have you had any flu like symptoms or infectious symptoms like a red eyes runny eyes runny nose or a sore throat ok you mentioned you felt feverish do you feel hot now ok did you have any night sweats alright and have you had any chest pain alright so how about any dizziness or lightheadedness ok and have you had any wheeze ok uhm and have you noticed any swelling to any of your extremities like your ankles ok and have you had any belly pain any urinary problems like pain or or frequency going to the bathroom and any diarrhea alright and have you noticed any rashes or or changes to your skin alright and i do not know you have had muscle aches have you had any joint pains ok and how has your energy been these last couple of days ok and have you tried any medications for the for the headache or any of your symptoms so far ok and in the past have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions ok and are you using medications for your diabetes ok have you used insulin before ok no that is great and that reminds me actually how has your weight been over the last several months have you had any weight changes no that is great though good for you i encourage you to keep that up for sure ok and so do you take any other medications other over the counter or prescribed alright and do you have any allergies to medications all right so have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries alright and anybody in the family have any like lung conditions heart conditions or diseases that run in the family ok uhm you do not have any asthma or problems breathing like that ok and right now so you mentioned your son and wife is that who you are living with ok and any exposures to to anybody who has been sick either at home or at work or or any other activities yeah so nobody that you are aware of who has been sick though and everybody at home has been ok ok and have you traveled anywhere ok and do you smoke cigarettes ok so do you do you smoke marijuana alright and you use any other recreational drugs like cocaine opioids heroin and how have you used anything like that in the past ok uhm and do you drink alcohol alright so i think that was all i wanted to ask on history today was there anything else that that you wanted to add before we go on to the exam and yeah so that is something that that is on the differential for what could be causing your symptoms especially with uhm starting at having a cough and the nonspecific viral type symptoms with the cough headache muscle aches so certainly could be caused by covid but there are other reasons for that could explain these symptoms such as other types of viral illnesses and so we will do a pcr swab today as well as do well check your vitals to see if you have a fever now and we will also maybe send an influenza swab as well and and do some blood work but in the meantime since we are running the covid swab it will be important to self isolate for the next 14 days and we will let you know what the test results show but despite even if they are negative it will be important to still stay self isolating for the next 14 days alright thank you",
