Alright, is there any other questions or concerns that you have or something I may have missed to ask you today?\n\nP: No, I don't think so. \n\nD: OK, so based on what we talked about from your swelling as well as breathlessness while laying down and your past history of a heart attack and high cholesterol, it may be likely with the medications you are on as well as your history, that you might be having what's called congestive heart failure. So we will need to do further investigations to determine if that is what it is and if we need to get you on something like lasix or a diuretic to get rid of some of the fluid that's building up in your body, which may be caused by heart failure. So we'll do some investigations and then go from there.",

marijuana no ok any alcohol no ok and in terms of your daily routine do you feel that you get 3 meals a day a well balanced diet i would not say well balanced i am trying to eat healthier but does not always happen ok and how about exercise do you find that your exercise levels or activity levels have gone down in the last 2 months yes ok alright is there any other questions or concerns that you have or something i may have missed to ask you today no i do not think so ok so based on what we talked about from your swelling as well as breathlessness while laying down and your past history of a heart attack and high cholesterol it may be likely with the medications you are on as well as your history that you might be having what is called congestive heart failure so we will need to do further investigations to determine if that is what it is and if we need to get you on something like lasix or a diuretic to get rid of some of the fluid that is building up in your body which may be caused by heart failure so we will do some investigations and then go from there",
