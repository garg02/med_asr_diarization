I can't even walk from the bedroom to the kitchen without becoming shortness of, like short of breath.\n\nD: OK, um OK, and when did that change happen?\n\nP: So I would say one week ago is when this all kind of started.\n\nD: OK, and has it been getting any better, worse, or staying the same?\n\nP: I would say it's kind of getting worse.

Like is it sharp, dull, or achy?\n\nP: It's more just an ache and it's kind of more of a discomfort than a pain, and it kind of goes away once my episode of coughing and shortness of breath is relieved with some rest.\n\nD: OK. Uh, and uh, have you been experiencing any fevers or chills?\n\nP: Yeah, I've been noticing that I'm getting a lot more chills this past week. They kind of come and go, but even at night I get like these chills that after wrap myself up in at least three blankets.\n\nD: OK, and have you had a fever?\n\nP: Uh, I didn't get a chance to measure any of them, but I might have had a fever just from the chills that I'm expecting that I had a fever.\n\nD: OK, and have you had any night sweats?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK and have you had any unexpected weight loss over the last several months?\n\nP: No, I think my weights been pretty steady.\n\nD: OK.

So one of them is just when I like need it, uh, like I've been using a lot more recently, like the Ventolin. And then I also have another inhaler called Spiriva that I've been using as well.\n\nD: OK, and do you have any allergies?\n\nP: Uhm I do have an allergy to sulfa drugs.\n\nD: And what reaction?\n\nP: I usually break out into hives.\n\nD: OK, and any prior surgeries or hospitalizations?\n\nP: So I've had a surgery to remove my appendix when I was really young. Then I've had another surgery for my hips as well, but yeah, other than that, no other issues. \n\nD: OK. And are your immunizations up to date?\n\nP: Yeah, all of my immunizations should be up to date.\n\nD: OK, excellent and could you tell me a little bit about where you're living currently and who you're living with?\n\nP: Yeah, so I, I currently live alone in, in an apartment just in the city. And yeah, I've been living alone for probably the last five years.\n\nD: OK, and have you been around anybody who's been sick?\n\nP: Uhm, not recently. I think I just I just go out to get groceries and stuff. I haven't really been going out too much.\n\nD: Alright, So have you traveled anywhere?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK uhm, do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: Maybe a couple of years a week.\n\nD: OK, and do you smoke cigarettes?\n\nP: Yeah, I still smoke cigarettes.

Uhm, and so do you use any recreational drugs?\n\nP: No, no no no drugs at all. \n\nD: OK. Uhm, and have you had a family history of heart disease or any lung conditions?\n\nP: Uhm, not, I mean like no lung conditions, but I have a family history like my both my grandather and father both had heart attacks in their 60s.\n\nD: OK, and any lung cancer in the family?\n\nP: No, not that I know of.\n\nD: OK. So I think that was all the questions that I I wanted to ask today. Was there anything else that I maybe forgot about that you wanted to mention? \n\nP: Uhm no, I think that those are all the questions I had and everything was covered.\n\nD: OK, uhm so uh, the next steps for now, I think, will be to, uh start, we'll get a physical exam in and your vital signs and get some investigations. It is sounding like a COPD exacerbation with the increasing and the change changing sputum. The increasing frequency of cough and the exertional shortness of breath as well, along with wheezing and kind of this chest discomfort that you're experiencing. And so, uh, this will require some antibiotics as well and depending on the severity of symptoms, possibly some steroids as well to help with the inflammation.\n\nP: OK, that sounds good. Thank you.\n\n",
