When did that start?\n\nP: So I've had a cough now for a few years, um but over this past uh three days it's gotten quite a bit worse.\n\nD:: OK, for the past three days, three three years. OK.\n\nP: Yeah.\n\nD: Um are there any triggers for your cough?\n\nP: Uh, yeah, if I'm doing, um, like if I'm really active like if I run to catch the bus or uh or if I'm shovelling snow, maybe I can make, become short of breath, but um not if I'm just walking around the block or anything like that.\n\nD: OK, and what caused this cough initially three years ago?

How often were you coughing before it got worse recently?\n\nP: Uh I would usually cough every day, but the cough would be, usually just in the morning, I I'd get up um, there, I would cough up some sputum and and then maybe, and then I'd usually be OK.\n\nD: OK, um and does anything make your cough better? Like do you take any over the counter cough syrup?\n\nP: Um yeah, I've tried some over the counter uh cough syrups in the past, but it hasn't helped.\n\nD: OK, OK, and if you were to talk about the quality of your cough, is it is it barky? Does it sound harsh? What does it sound like? \n\nP: Uh yeah, I would say it sounds pretty harsh. You can kind of, it sounds like there's um mucus moving around, I guess with with the cough in my chest, I can I can kind of feel it\n\nD: OK, OK and you mentioned that you're producing a lot of sputum with your cough.

And if you were to rate the severity of your symptoms, of how you're feeling, 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, where would you put yourself at?\n\nP: Uh I would say an 8, it's been really tough, it's been getting really difficult to um breathe. \n\nD: OK, yeah.

Was it intentional weight loss or unintentional?\n\nP: Unintentional. \n\nD: OK, um alright, and any changes to your hair, nails or skin, like rashes?\n\nP: No, I haven't noticed anything like that.\n\nD: OK, and how are your bowel movements?

When did you start taking that?\n\nP: About uh seven years ago.\n\nD: OK, and then for your uh COPD, which inhalers are you on?\n\nP: Uh, there's one that's for, um, like short acting. And then there's one that I use everyday, uh Spiriva, I think.\n\nD: OK, yeah. And how long have you been on these inhalers?\n\nP: Uh it's been a couple of years for well, for the the short one that I I use for rescue therapies been for like a long time, but Spiriva's been the last several years.\n\nD: OK, OK, and do you find that your inhalers are helping?\n\nP: Yeah. They um, I definitely notice a difference when I, if I miss a dose or something. \n\nD: Yeah, OK. And um, do you have any allergies?\n\nP: Uh no, I don't think so.\n\nD: No, OK. How about um immunizations, are you up to date?\n\nP: Yeah, I believe so. \n\nD: OK.

Um and any reasons to think that there are any old carpets, mold, or um asbestos or anything like that that could be exacerbating your symptoms?\n\nP: Uh I mean I do have a carpet in the bedroom so, but I mean that that's the only carpet in the apartment. \n\nD: OK. Um and do you live with anyone?\n\nP: No, it's it's just me and my dog.\n\nD: OK. Uh have you, have you been around any sick contacts recently? \n\nP: Um maybe, I mean I I usually will see uh, a couple of friends, we'll meet up to grab some coffee\nin the morning in the morning um but I feel like they have been uh OK.\n\nD: Yeah OK, how about um travel, have you traveled anywhere recently? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, OK. OK, well I think those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns or anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss? \n\nP: Um no, I just wanted to, um, yeah, come in because it's been really difficult to breathe.\n\nD: Yeah, so OK, well we'll do a physical exam on you um to try to understand um how bad your COPD exacerbation is. Um we'll also try to get an um oxygen saturation on you, and we do want that reading\nto be between 88 to 92%. If it is less than that um and we think you have a mild exacerbation, we'll just suggest that you use your short acting beta agonist puffer um more often, and then if you,\nif we think you have moderate, um moderate exacerbation we'll also prescribe uh antibiotics and or steroids to go along with the short acting beta agonist. And if it is severe, or if it becomes severe, um please do seek out aid um in the ER and they'll try, they'll probably put you on um uh some sort of, um oxy like um some sort of supplemental oxygen, whether it's BiPAP or CPAP. Um and again they'll continue giving you your bronchodilators and steroids, as well as antibiotics to um make sure that you don't have any bad complications of uh pneumonia. Um and it does sound like it is a COPD exacerbation at this point, but if you develop any other symptoms like um fevers, or any symptoms that overlap with uh viral viral illnesses, we'll we'll we'll work you up for that, we'll do, I think we will still do a covid swab on you just to make sure you don't have that, uh but we'll start with um working you up for COPD. How does that sound? \n\nP: That sounds great. Thank you.\n\nD: Alright. Take care.",

am really active like if i run to catch the bus or or if i am shoveling snow maybe i can make become short of breath but not if i am just walking around the block or anything like that ok and what caused this cough initially 3 years ago do you know yeah i think i think it is just a smokers cough i think that my family doctor told me i had like chronic bronchitis before ok ok how often were you coughing before it got worse recently i would usually cough every day but the cough would be usually just in the morning i i would get up there i would cough up some sputum and and then maybe and then i would usually be ok ok and does anything make your cough better like do you take any over the counter cough syrup yeah i have tried some over the counter cough syrups in the past but it has not helped ok ok and if you were to talk about the quality of your cough is it is it barky does it sound harsh what does it sound like yeah i would say it sounds pretty harsh you can kind of it sounds like there is mucus moving around i guess with with the cough in my chest i can i can kind of feel it ok ok and you mentioned that you are producing a lot of sputum with your cough what color is that sputum greenish green ok any blood no blood no blood ok and you mentioned you have never produced sputum with the cough especially not green sputum in the past 3 years right i would bring up sputum but it is usually clear and white ok ok and do you have any wheeziness associated with this cough yes i do yes ok and you mentioned you were short of breath were you short of breath prior to your cough or did that start when when this cough got worse i think the shortness of breath has gotten a bit worse over the last few days as the cough has gotten worse ok ok and if you were to rate the severity of your symptoms of how you are feeling one to 10 10 being the worst where would you put yourself at i would say an 8 it has been really tough it has been getting really difficult to breathe ok yeah and have you ever experienced anything to this severity in the past no i have not had this difficulty breathing before ok ok do you have any chest pain my chest is it feels tight ok it feels tight ok does that does it hurt though no no it does not really hurt it is just uncomfortable ok and do you think it is tight because of the coughing or the shortness of breath yeah i kind of feel it
