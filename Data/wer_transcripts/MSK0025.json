I was taken to the ER. They did like a full work up on me. The only thing on my back that they found was a slipped disc and then they said that should that shouldn't cause me too much pain. But if I was having any of these symptoms that I'm having now I should go back, or see a doctor at least. And and otherwise I was fine like I didn't lose a lot of blood or I didn't need any surgical interventions at that point.\n\nD: OK, I see.

Is it just one like that's ah weak or both legs?\n\nP: So both like seem weak but the right more than the left.\n\nD: OK, I see. Uhm, and does this weakness seem to get worse, or is it around the same as it was when it started?\n\nP: It's it's it feels like it's getting worse.\n\nD: OK, do you have any past medical conditions you have been diagnosed with?\n\nP: I had hypothyroid, so I've been taking Synthroid for that.\n\nD: OK, any other medications?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, any allergies to any medications? \n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK.

And are you able to do things at home that you were before look like, or do you need some extra help from it, your family members, or extra help from other workers. Anything like that?\n\nP: Yeah, my family's definitely been helping me out a lot over these past few weeks because. Yeah, like I said, like I'm having some weakness in my legs. I can't move around as much because I'm in so much pain. Um and then like there are all these like bladder accidents so. Yeah, they've been helping me out with everyday things. \n\nD: OK, I see. And currently, do you smoke?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, do you drink alcohol? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: And any recreational drugs like marijuana?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. I'm just getting at you to do a few things on just just as part of the physical examination.\n\nP: Sure.\n\nD: Are you able to bend down or extend your back at all, or is it too painful?\n\nP: Yeah, I can't do that. It's too painful.\n\nD: Do you notice any kind of redness, swelling in and around your back?\n\nP: Um not that I can tell.\n\nD: OK, and how about if you press down on the your lower back, does it hurt? \n\nP: Yeah, that hurts. \n\nD: OK.

It's yeah, it's too painful.\n\nD: I see, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you so it seems. It's great, it's good that you came to the emergency Department. Do you have any questions at all?\n\nP: No, just like how can I fix this?\n\nD: Yeah, so based on your symptoms, it's something that's pretty urgent. It's seems like you may be having something called cauda Equina syndrome that may be caused by your back pain and that's why you're feeling that groin would be called saddle anesthesia and then the urinary incontinence. So this may be from the injury that you had with the car accident. And it may be due to some compression of what we call like compression of the nerves in the area which might be giving you some of these symptoms. So the first thing we do need to do is get an MRI of your lower back just to make sure there's nothing going on like for example, like any masses in the area or any kind of abscesses that might be. We may be worried about just to make sure. Well, just to see what's going on in there that's causing these symptoms. And then based on what we find, uh, we will, we will target like the cause of the symptoms, like for example if it's an infect infection that's causing this, you might need to be admitted and require antibiotics. If there is any masses causing it, you may require surgery. For example if it's mainly related to your back it is something that we will have to treat with with an admission so it's good that you came in here today. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nP: No, that was it. Thank you so much for your help.\n\nD: You're welcome and will get back to you shortly.\n",

just achey and i do not really have any in any of these other issues but over the past 2 weeks it is gotten sharp and i am having all these other symptoms ok and so you are having the set like what is called some numbness in your groin is that unilateral like on one side or both sides uhm it seems like it is both sides ok and so and then you are also having the urinary incontinence how long is that been going on for the past week ok and what about the numbness in your groin area that has been going on for the past week as well ok and ok and how would you describe your pain right now on a scale of one to 10 10 being the worst pain you have felt i would say it is like an 8 or 9 8 or 9 ok and does it get worse with any any motions at all i think it is worse with i do not know like it is worse with anything anytime anytime i tried to move it it hurts ok so you just improved with rest complete rest yeah ok does it travel in does the pain travel anywhere else does it shoot down your legs at all yeah so it does shoot down my legs and i am having a hard time walking because of that is it both legs or just one it is mostly on my right but the left one is not the same as it used to be either ok yeah i am having a hard time like getting up from a chair and things like that ok and anything that you have tried that has helped relieve some of your symptoms i have tried like over the counter counter and ibuprofen i have tried some topical analgesics and nothing seems to be working ok and have you experienced any trauma so you mentioned you had a car accident rate 2 months ago yes that was yeah that was 2 months ago ok and then were you in the hospital admitted to the hospital for for a while or how what happened in your treatment yeah i was i was taken to the er they did like a full work up on me the only thing on my back that they found was a slipped disk and then they said that should that should not cause me too much pain but if i was having any of these symptoms that i am having now i should go back or see a doctor at least and and otherwise i was fine like i did not lose a lot of blood or i did not need any surgical interventions at that point ok i see and have you been having any other symptoms or any any pain in any other joints or muscles uhm no no nothing like that ok any fevers or chills no any night sweats no rashes or skin changes no any kind of chest pain short of ah sorry shortness of breath no any cough or cold like symptoms no uhm any so you have some urinary incontinence any fecal incontinence no ok how is an any recent changes in your weight no have you been sick at all recently no ok any tingling sensation either in your back or shooting down your legs no any burning sensation little bit of burning sensation yeah ok do you have any numbness in your lower limbs or just numbness around the groin just numbness around the groin area but my lower limbs do seem weak ok so you have muscle weakness is it just one like that is ah weak or both legs so both like seem weak but the right more than the left ok i see uhm and does this weakness seem to get worse or is it around the same as it was when it started it is it is it feels like it is getting worse ok do you have any past medical conditions you have been diagnosed with i had hypothyroid so i have been taking synthroid for that ok any other medications no ok any allergies to any medications no ok any hospitalizations or previous surgeries no any family history of any musculoskeletal or rheumatologic conditions no ok currently do you work i do i work from home right now i am a teacher ok and do you did you do any work previously that required heavy lifting or strenuous activities regarding your back at all no no nothing like that and what is your home and living situation like right now i live at home with 2 of my children ok and are you able to do things at home that you were before look like or do you need some extra help from it your family members or extra help from other workers anything like that yeah my family is definitely been helping me out a lot over these past few weeks because yeah like i said like i am having some weakness in my legs i can not move around as much because i am in so much pain and then like there are all these like bladder accidents so yeah they have been helping me out with everyday things ok i see and currently do you smoke no ok do you drink alcohol no and any recreational drugs like marijuana no ok i am just getting at you to do a few things on just just as part of the physical examination sure are you able to bend down or extend your back at all or is it too painful yeah i can not do that it is too painful do you notice any kind of redness swelling in and around your back not that i can tell ok and how about if you press down on the your lower back does it hurt yeah that hurts ok and are you experiencing the numbness right now and in your groin area i am are you able to raise your legs when in a lying position with straight legs knees not bending at all they are able to raise without any pain no i can not do that it is yeah it is too painful i see alright so those are all the questions i had for you so it seems it is great it is good that you came to the emergency department do you have any questions at all no just like how can i fix this yeah so based on your symptoms it is something that is pretty urgent it is seems like you may be having something called cauda equina syndrome that may be caused by your back pain and that is why you are feeling that groin would be called saddle anesthesia and then the urinary incontinence so this may be from the injury that you had with the car accident and it may be due to some compression of what we call like compression of the nerves in the area which might be giving you some of these symptoms so the 1st thing we do need to do is get an mri of your lower back just to make sure there is nothing going on like for example like any masses in the area or any kind of abscesses that might be we may be worried about just to make sure well just to see what is going on in there that is causing these symptoms and then based on what we find we will we will target like the cause of the symptoms like for example if it is an infect infection that is causing this you might need to be admitted and require antibiotics if there is any masses causing it you may require surgery for example if it is mainly related to your back it is something that we will have to treat with with an admission so it is good that you came in here today do you have any other questions or concerns no that was it thank you so much for your help you are welcome and will get back to you shortly",
