    "ref": "D: Would you mind by starting to tell me what brought you in?\n\nP: Sure, my 5 year old daughter, I noticed that she's been coughing a lot over the past two days. She sounds like she has a stuffy nose and now she's got this pink eye so I just wanted to get it checked out by you. \n\nD: Yeah, for sure. So the cough started 5 days ago?\n\nP: Two days ago.\n\nD: OK and is the cough barky or harsh sounding?\n\nP: Yes, it sounds harsh.\n\nD: OK, alright was there anything that changed two days ago that might have triggered the cough?\n\nP: I don't think so, although she does go to daycare. \n\nD: OK, uh and so has she been bringing up any sputum with the cough?\n\nP: No, no sputum that I've noticed.\n\nD: OK, notice any blood?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: Alright, and is the cough worse at any particular time of day?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and has there been any wheezing?\n\nP: No, not that I noticed.\n\nD: OK. And you mentioned the red eyes. When did you notice that?\n\nP: That was just yesterday.\n\nD: OK, any discharge from the eyes?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, nothing like that? No tearing or anything like that?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. Umm and has she complained about any like changes to vision?\n\nP No, not really, just the pain.\n\nD: No. OK, uh, and how about any itchiness in the eyes? \n\nP: She's been rubbing it and so it's possibly itchy. \n\nD: OK. And have you noticed any mucus coming out?\n\nP: Umm, no, it's actually stuffy. \n\nD: OK\n\nP: Yeah, not so much mucous. \n\nD: OK, has she mentioned anything about losing smell?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, umm and has she mentioned anything about being congested?\n\nP: She just sounds like she's congested.\n\nD: OK. Umm any sore throat?\n\nP: Umm, possibly. \n\nD: OK, how has she been eating?\n\nP: Um, she's been eating OK. I guess she's been eating alittle less than usual. \n\nD: OK umm, would you say that she's been going to the bathroom as often as normal?\n\nP: Yep, I would say so.\n\nD: No changes there, OK. Um and has she had any loss of taste?\n\nP: Umm, possibly since she's not eating as much. \n\nD: OK. Any fevers or chills?\n\nP: Um, she did feel a little bit hot, but I didn't take her temperature.\n\nD: OK, so hot. We will definitely check for fever today. Any night sweats?\n\nP: Umm, no. \n\nD: OK. And has she been gaining weight OK?\n\nP: Yep, Yep, no change, nothing abnormal there.\n\nD: OK, and has she been complaining about having any stomach pains?\n\nP: Umm, no. \n\nD: OK, has she had any nausea or vomiting? \n\nP: Um no no.\n\nD: OK, and how about any painful urination?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, and any diarrhea?\\\n\nP: Umm, no.\n\nD: OK, and has she mentioned anything about headaches?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. And how about any aches or pains anywhere?\n\nP: Uh, no, I don't think so.\n\nD: Have you noticed any rashes? \n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and has she been diagnosed with any conditions before?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK. And any reason for her to be hospitalized?\n\nP: Uh, no. \n\nD: OK, um does she take any medications regularly?\n\nP: Um, no. \n\nD: OK, does she have any allergies to medications? \n\nP: Umm, no. \n\nD: Alright, any surgeries before? \n\nP: Umm, no.\n\nD: Any concerns with her growth or development?\n\nP: Umm, no, everything's been pretty normal.\n\nD: OK, and any concerns about her vision or hearing? \n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. And can tell you tell me a little bit about the living situation currently? Are you the primary caregiver?\n\nP: I am.\n\nD: OK, and who else is in the home?\n\nP: Her father. \n\nD: OK, are there any pets around?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: Alright. And does anybody in the house smoke?\n\nP: No, no one smokes. \n\nD: OK, any exposures in the house to like carpets or dust or inhalants that might bring on a cough?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK. Ummm and uhh anybody in the family been sick?\n\nP: No. \n\nD: OK, and how about anybody you mentioned at the daycare? Was anybody been sick there?\n\nP: No, I don't think so. I contacted them and checked, but it seems like no one's been sick. \n\nD: OK, and you say you haven't traveled anywhere?\n\nP: Oh no, no, not recently. \n\nD: OK. And any lung conditions or heart conditions that run in the family?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: OK, and how about any genetic conditions or congenital conditions in the family?\n\nP: No, none, none that I know of.\n\nD: OK, so the main symptoms are the cough that started two days ago and also you've noticed she's been congested. And sorry, what was the last symptom?\n\nP: She has this pink eye and she has a cough.\n\nD: Yeah, right, that could be conjunctivitis. OK, so at this point we will certainly run some investigations to look into what this could be. It sounds like a viral infectious type of process, especially if it's involving the eyes, nose, and and with a cough. And so we will test with a swab for covid for sure. But it could be something more common, like the common cold. We just need to make sure that we're comprehensive in that with the testing.\n\nP: That sounds great, thank you.",
