Um he's been kind of just having discomfort um and over the last few days uh he also started crying because of how much pain he is having, and then um we also noticed that he had like was just feeling warm, so we took his temperature and he actually had a fever just yesterday of like 39 degrees Celsius.\n\nD: OK, uhm, alright. So let's back up just a little bit. The ear pain, when did that start? You said a couple of days ago, so was that two, three, four days? \n\nP: Uh I think the discomfort like uh, we saw him scratching his ear for the whole last week, but uh the crying actually started just I would say four days ago, um. \n\nD: OK.\n\nP: So I think the last few days have been really tough for him.\n\nD: Yeah, so three, four days. OK, have you taken a look into his ear? Like does does it seem red? Is there discharge?\n\nP: Uh I think we did see some uh, just like it wasn't red or anything, but I think we did uh see some um just kind of clear to almost uh clear to yellowish fluid from his affected ear.\n\nD: OK, clear to, you said white-ish? \n\nP: Uh like it was a bit of a yellow tinge to to it as well.\n\nD: Yellow, OK, OK. And which ear was it, sorry, the right or left?\n\nP: Left ear. \n\nD: Left ear, OK. And the right ear looks normal?\n\nP: Yeah, right ear, he hasn't been complaining uh at all. I haven't even looked at the right ear yet.\n\nD: OK, is he itching his ears at all?\n\nP: Uh he was he was itching like pretty much this whole week, but I think right now he's hesitant to even touch his ears.\n\nD: OK, and does it look like it's angry on the outside or on the inside of his ears?\n\nP: I can't really see anything on the outside.\n\nD: OK, OK, and have you noticed that his hearing has changed at all?\n\nP: Um he still like answers to us and like I don't think his ear, hearing is affected.\n\nD: OK. Has he had any past issues with his ears, like ear infections or like hearing issues in the past?\n\nP: Uh no hearing issues, but he did have uh like he used to, probably when he was uh like 2 years old, he did have a couple ear infections.\n\nD: OK, OK. Were they were they treated with antibiotics?\n\nP: Uh I think one time they were, but I I'm pretty sure that was on, in his right ear.\n\nD: OK, OK. He's never had to get like tubes inserted or anything like that?\n\nP: No, no, nothing like that.\n\nD: No, OK. Um, alright. Um has he had a stuffy nose or runny nose?\n\nP: Uh not this week, but he he was a bit like stuffy like last week I would say.\n\nD: OK, he was a bit stuffy, you said?\n\nP: Yeah, maybe even, maybe two weeks ago.\n\nD: OK. And that stopped. Did he have anything else along with his stuffy nose at that point?\n\nP: No, nothing else.\n\nD: Um right now, have you noticed any changes in his vision, in his smell or taste?\n\nP: Uh mo, not that I know of.\n\nD: OK, how about weight loss?\n\nP: No, he's been um growing pretty well.\n\nD: OK, and you said um you had taken his temperature.

Um alright, and how about uh nausea or vomiting?\n\nP: Uh no, no, no nausea or vomiting.\n\nD: Any appetite change?\n\nP: Uh no, uh, maybe a little bit more fussy just, but I don't know if that's probably due to the pain. \n\nD: OK. Um and how about his urine?\n\nP: Uh his urine has been the same, like no changes.\n\nD: No changes, OK good. Is he an otherwise healthy kid or does he have any longstanding conditions?\n\nP: Yeah, he's pretty healthy. There have been no concerns at all that we've had for the doctor. Uh he's been growing well, um meeting all of his milestones. Um yeah, no, nothing that's concerning.\n\nD: OK, um do you know if his mother's pregnancy with him was normal? Did she have any complications?\n\nP: Um she didn't have any like complications during the pregnancy. Uh they did have to, um I forgot what it's called, but uh he was like a difficult baby coming out. Um and he was at term though, he wasn't premature, but they had to use just um some tools to get him out.\n\nD: OK, OK. Um so it was a vaginal delivery, but they used some tools like forceps maybe or vacuum?\n\nP: Yeah, yeah it was forceps, yeah.\n\nD: OK, OK. Um and he's, you mentioned he was full term?\n\nP: Yeah, he was born at uh 40 weeks.\n\nD: OK, perfect. Did he need to be hospitalized for any reason after that?\n\nP: No, he wasn't hospitalized. Uh we stayed there maybe one day extra just because um there was some just kind of misshaping of his head.\n\nD: OK.\n\nP: That kind of went away. \n\nD: OK, OK, good. And is he on any medications? \n\nP: Uh no, no medications.\n\nD: No medications, up to date with his immunizations?\n\nP: Yeah, he's all up to date.\n\nD: OK, any allergies?\n\nP: Um not that we know of.\n\nD: OK, how about family history of lung conditions, heart conditions?\n\nP: Um no, we've been pretty healthy as parents. Um and I think my my father has like high blood pressure, diabetes, and all those types of things.\n\nD: OK, OK, any um ear issues like congenital ear, sorry um, genetic hearing issues or ear issues? \n\nP: No, nothing like that.\n\nD: OK, um does anyone at home smoke?\n\nP: No, no one smokes.\n\nD: OK. Um and who does he live with?\n\nP: So he lives with um me, his father, and his mother as well. \n\nD: OK. Uhm, any siblings?\n\nP: No siblings, he's an only child.\n\nD: OK, and how are things at home, um is like, are things financially stable? Any relationship issues?\n\nP: No, we've been pretty uh fortunate like it it's, no financial issues uh and we have a lot of support from our parents as well. Uh the relationship is great, so no, no issues.\n\nD: OK, good good. Um has he had any sick contacts recently?\n\nP: Um I don't think so. He's, we've been at home so I don't know. We we did have like, with our with my brother's uh kids like uh they came to see us once um but that was like, that was, I think at like three weeks ago.\n\nD: OK, OK, three weeks ago. Alright, um travel to anywhere recently?\n\nP: No.\n\nD: No, OK. Alright, those were all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions that you wanted to ask me today before we end the interview?\n\nP: Uh no, not really. Just wanted to know if, like I remember he did need antibiotics before so I was just wondering if he needs them now.\n\nD: Yeah, um so, well first, because some of his symptoms overlap with Covid, like the fever especially, we'll do a swab on him anyways um and you should hear those results in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and then it, this picture sounds like acute otitis media, so like an ear infection. And um it's especially likely because he's had them in the past, so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before like um coming up with a management plan. But I'll kind of walk you through what we look at. So if I take a look and I see like a perforated tympanic membrane with like pus, we'd prescribe like 10 days of um antibiotics. If he has some like middle ear effusion, so like some fluids with like a bulging tympanic membrane and he appears to be really ill, uh which from the sounds of it, he sounds ill, he's had this fever for more than two days, we'll also prescribe antibiotics for 10 days. And then, if it's just some middle ear effusion, so just that clear fluid um or just the bulging tympanic membrane, we can just um reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see how he's doing. And if he's worse, again, we'll prescribing prescribe him some antibiotics. Um the antibiotics that we usually prescribe are amoxicillin, and because he doesn't have a penicillin allergy, that should work.\n\nP: OK.\n\nD: Yeah, how does that sound?\n\nP: That sounds good. Thank you so much.\n\nD: OK, great, thank you.",

ear ok ok he is never had to get like tubes inserted or anything like that no no nothing like that no ok alright has he had a stuffy nose or runny nose not this week but he he was a bit like stuffy like last week i would say ok he was a bit stuffy you said yeah maybe even maybe 2 weeks ago ok and that stopped did he have anything else along with his stuffy nose at that point no nothing else

you noticed any rashes on him no no how about coughing no he has not been really coughing no coughing how about wheezing or shortness of breath no like anything that would indicate he has chest pain or palpitations of his heart no i do not think so no ok any dizziness or fainting spells no confusion no i do not think so headaches not that i know of ok and how how have his bowel movements been his bowel movements have been pretty much the same he is yeah there has been no real changes no ok alright and how about nausea or vomiting no no no nausea or vomiting any appetite change no maybe a little bit more fussy just but i do not know if that is probably due to the pain ok and how about his urine his urine has been the same like no changes no changes ok good is he an otherwise healthy kid or does he have any longstanding conditions yeah he is pretty healthy there have been no concerns at all that we have had for the doctor he has been growing well meeting all of his milestones yeah no nothing that is concerning ok do you know if his mother is pregnancy with him was normal did she have any complications she did not have any like complications during the pregnancy they did have to i forgot what it is called but he was like a difficult baby coming out and he was at term though he was not premature but they had to use just some tools to get him out ok ok so it was a vaginal delivery but they used some tools like forceps maybe or vacuum yeah yeah it was forceps yeah ok ok and he is you mentioned he was full term yeah he was born at 40 weeks ok perfect did he need to be hospitalized for any reason after that no he was not hospitalized we stayed there maybe one day extra just because there was some just kind of misshaping of his head ok that kind of went away ok ok good and is he on any medications no no medications no medications up to date with his immunizations yeah he is all up to date ok any allergies not that we know of ok how about family history of lung conditions heart conditions no we have been pretty healthy as parents and i think my my father has like high blood pressure diabetes and all those types of things ok ok any ear issues like congenital ear sorry genetic hearing issues or ear issues no nothing like that ok does anyone at home smoke no no one smokes ok and who does he live with so he lives with me his father and his mother as well ok uhm any siblings no siblings he is an only child ok and how are things at home is like are things financially stable any relationship issues no we have been pretty fortunate like it it is no financial issues and we have a lot of support from our parents as well the relationship is great so no no issues ok good good has he had any sick contacts recently i do not think so he is we have been at home so i do not know we we did have like with our with my brother is kids like they came to see us once but that was like that was i think at like 3 weeks ago ok ok 3 weeks ago alright travel to anywhere recently no no ok alright those were all the questions i had for you today do you have any questions that you wanted to ask me today before we end the interview no not really just wanted to know if like i remember he did need antibiotics before so i was just wondering if he needs them now yeah so well 1st because some of his symptoms overlap with covid like the fever especially we will do a swab on him anyways and you should hear those results in about 24 to 48 hours and then it this picture sounds like acute otitis media so like an ear infection and it is especially likely because he is had them in the past so i am going to have to take a look into his ears 1st before like coming up with a management plan but i will kind of walk you through what we look at so if i take a look and i see like a perforated tympanic membrane with like pus we would prescribe like 10 days of antibiotics if he has some like middle ear effusion so like some fluids with like a bulging tympanic membrane and he appears to be really ill which from the sounds of it he sounds ill he is had this fever for more than 2 days we will also prescribe antibiotics for 10 days and then if it is just some middle ear effusion so just that clear fluid or just the bulging tympanic membrane we can just reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see how he is doing and if he is worse again we will prescribing prescribe him some antibiotics the antibiotics that we usually prescribe are amoxicillin and because he does not have a penicillin allergy that should work ok yeah how does that sound that sounds good thank you so much ok great thank you",
