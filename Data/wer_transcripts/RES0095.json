will uhm get a look at some of the old or some of the reports from uhm over the last several months from and from the cardiologist you see but it is and then also we will get some blood work and a chest x ray but it is sounding like this could be a heart failure exacerbation which so some of the shortness of breath it could be coming from fluid uhm that has accumulated in your lungs and so we will give you 0 another type of water pill now furosemide to try and help get rid of some of that fluid so it will help with the breathing and in the meantime we will wait for the investigations to come back sure thank you",
