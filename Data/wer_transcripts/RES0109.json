But in the meantime you should self isolate for 14 days.\n\nP: Sure.\n\nD: Um but it I think it does really sound like you have a common cold um so just like another viral illness, um so just treat it supportively you know um keep yourself hydrated, if you feel like you're getting a fever, take like Tylenol. Um if you have like pain like a headache or like sinus pressure or something you can take again an Advil or Tylenol. Um And if your symptoms worsen, or if you have any neurological symptoms, then you should see the ER um right away.\n\nP: Sure.\n\nD: Yeah, OK sounds good.\n\nP: Great.\n",
