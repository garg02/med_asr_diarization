    "ref": "D: I would just like to start with what brought you in here today to the family clinic?\n\nP: Yeah, so I've been coughing for a few months now and so that's the problem.\n\nD: OK, and how many months have you been coughing for?\n\nP: Just over two, I would say, and it's been I've been bringing up this yellow, greenish sputum. It's kind of gross.\n\nD: OK, and how, how much of the sputum would you say you're bringing up in an average day? Like a teaspoon? Tablespoon?\n\nP: : Oh I see OK. I don't know, maybe a few teaspoons throughout the day.\n\nD: OK.\n\nP: At first I thought I I I had a, a chest infection, but even after antibiotics from my GP, or or my family doctor, It never cleared up. \n\nD: OK, and so when did you go on the antibiotics?\n\nP: Ah so this is about, uh, about a month ago. \n\nD: Mhmm.\n\nP: And yeah, so I went to see my family doctor about the cough then and dad was prescribed some antibiotics. I think azithromycin and it, it still didn't, it didn't do anything. \n\nD: OK, I see. And do you find that your cough has been getting worse since then?\n\nP: Uh, I would say the cough has been about the same.\n\nD: OK. But how about the sputum that you're bringing up, has that increased? \n\nP: Uh, it's about the same, but it definitely I would say there's a pink tinge in the sputum now. Every once in awhile I've noticed more than than before.\n\nD: OK. And did this all start after the chest infection or did you have something like this occur before?\n\nP: Um, yeah, this all started after.\n\nD: OK, I see. Was there anything that happened around that time? Any new environment that you were exposed to?\n\nP: Ah, well, I did go to India a few months ago.\n\nD: OK, and how many months was that? Was that also like two months ago? \n\nP: Yeah, about that, probably closer to three or four, but yeah, right around the time that that I think this, uhm cough started or just before I got back.\n\nD: OK, I see. And how often are you coughing in a day? \n\nP: Ah. a few times an hour.\n\nD: OK. Anything that makes your cough go away now you've tried?\n\nP: Uh, no nothings really helped it go away.\n\nD: OK, and is it better or worse? During good morning as opposed to night?\n\nP: Uh, it's pretty, it's pretty bad all day actually and it's been impacting my sleep because I've been coughing at night too.\n\nD: I see. And, um, in terms of things that make it worse, anything you do around the house or at work that makes the coughing worse?\n\nP: Uh yeah, I guess if I'm just moving around a little bit more it might bring it on a little bit more, but it's pretty bad all day.\n\nD: I see. And in terms of any other symptoms you might be having, uh, do you have any shortness of breath, runny nose, any chest pain?\n\nP: Um, no, not really.\n\nD: OK. Besides the pain tinged sputum, have you ever coughed up blood, like red blood?\n\nP: Not anything that was really bright red. More pink.\n\nD: More pink. OK. Yeah, so you traveled to India just two months ago. Do you remember what kind of place you stayed in India? Was it a, a in a crowded place or were you by yourself?\n\nP: Well, I mean there is a lot of people around. Yeah, there was not a lot of room where I was was staying, so it was pretty crowded.\n\nD: OK, and was there anyone that was ill around you or any exposure to tuberculosis?\n\nP: Uhm, not that I'm not aware of. I was around my family but, umm, I guess it's possible.\n\nD: OK. And once you came back did anyone else, in your family get sick? Or was it just you?\n\nP: Oh yeah, I spoke to my relative went when I got back and they they didn't tell me about one of my cousins there that was feeling sick.\n\nD: OK. And have you been having any fevers or chills?\n\nP: Yeah, I feel I feel like I've been pretty pretty hot sometimes.\n\nD: OK, and how about night sweats?\n\nP: Yeah, the coughs been messing with my sleep, and I've been waking up with night sweats. \n\nD: OK. And have you been having any headaches?\n\nP: Ah no headaches.\n\nD: Any do you feel that you've lost any weight recently? \n\nP: Uh, maybe a few pounds, but um.\n\nD: Have you tried to lose weight, or was that unintentional?\n\nP: No, I, I was kind of surprised. I thought I would have gained weight 'cause I've been a bit more lazy recently, but the weight seems to be down anyway.\n\nD: I see, OK. Have you noticed any wheezing sounds when you breathe out, or breathe in?\n\nP: No wheezing. \n\nD: OK. And you mentioned no chest pain, right?\n\nP: Yeah, no chest pain.\n\nD: OK, have you noticed any kind of swelling in your legs or hands or anywhere else in your body?\n\nP: No swelling. \n\nD: OK.

And are you taking any medications for any of those? \n\nP: Yeah, I'm taking uhm, a few medications for blood pressure and uh, and and diabetes right now, and I think I Rosuvastatin for for the cholesterol. I'm not sure of the other ones though.\n\nD: OK, no worries.

And has anyone ever had anything like pulmonary fibrosis or any autoimmune conditions?\n\nP: Uhm. What are those?\n\nD: So pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in your lung where you start getting like these nodules.\n\nP: I see.\n\nD: And it can run in the family and that can cause some of the symptoms like a chronic cough. It can cause sometimes shortness of breath and it can sometimes be associated with the like some connective tissue disorders that can run in the family.
