I also have this thing called fatty liver but that's that's about it, and a high blood pressure.\n\nD: OK, when were you diagnosed with all of these things?\n\nP: Yeah, probably like, it all kind of went down in my 40s. I did gain a lot of weight at some point during my 40s and that's when all these things started happening.\n\nD: OK, so you said diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver, and sorry, what was the other one?\n\nP: High cholesterol. \n\nD: High cholesterol, OK, are you on medications for all of these things? \n\nP: Yeah so I am on a statin medication for the cholesterol, then I'm on metformin, and then I'm on a blood pressure medication as well. I can't recall the name. Uh, so yeah, those are the medications that I'm on.\n\nD: OK. And do you take your medications regularly as prescribed?\n\nP: Yeah, I don't miss any doses.\n\nD: OK, good. And, are you up to date with all your immunizations?\n\nP: Yeah, I think so.\n\nD: OK, good. Do you have any allergies?\n\nP: No, no allergies.\n\nD: How about family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?\n\nP: Yes, I have a pretty significant family history for heart conditions. My father passed away from a heart attack in his 50s. My mom has high blood pressure. Diabetes is also pretty big in my family as well.\n\nD: OK, well I'm sorry to hear that. Any cancers in the family?\n\nP: No, no cancers.\n\nD: OK, do you smoke?\n\nP: I used to when I was in my 30s. I quit a pretty long time ago. \n\nD: OK, how much did you smoke before that?\n\nP: I probably smoked up until I was 35, so for probably like 10 years from 25 to 35 and probably smoked a pack a day at that time. \n\nD: OK, yeah, and do you drink alcohol?\n\nP: I've been told like, not to for my liver, but I sometimes maybe have the rare red wine maybe once a month.\n\nD: Once a month, OK, any other recreational drugs?\n\nP: No, no recreational drugs.\n\nD: OK, no recreational drugs, and where do you live right now?\n\nP: I just live with my wife in an apartment in the city, and yeah.\n\nD: OK, any old carpet, dust, mold, anything that is concerning from that standpoint? \n\nP: Nope. \n\nD: No, and have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?\n\nP: Not that I know of.\n\nD: Do you still go to work?\n\nP: I just have like a desk job. I have my own room. It's not like, I don't see too many people and like, when I do I'm wearing a mask so I don't think so. \n\nD: OK.\n\nP: I have stopped going to work though like, just in case.\n\nD: OK, good and have you traveled to anywhere recently?\n\nP: No, we've been pretty homebound.\n\nD: Pretty homebound, OK, alright, well that's good and those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for myself?\n\nP: Yeah, I don't know, what do you think is causing all of this?\n\nD: Yeah, it sounds like you have some sort of infection, so the first thing we need to rule out is covid, of course. So we'll do a swab and those swabs should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours and until then, it's important that you do isolate and you isolate for 14 days at least, and that includes from other people at home. And if those swabs come back negative, you could possibly have like, another infection. But if your symptoms worsen, like you start getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should come back to the ER and we'll get that checked out. And, so that's where we'll start for now, because your presentation is acute, we think it's likely infection related.\n\nP: OK, that sounds good to me and should I be staying in my own room or anything like that at home?\n\nD: Yeah, if you can like, it's recommended that you try to isolate in your own room for the next 14 days because your symptoms do overlap with that of covid, yeah.\n\nP: OK, sounds good.Thank you.\n\nD: Yeah, no worries, take care.\n\nP: Thank you.",

like rashes no nothing that i have noticed how about changes in your vision or hearing no no ok how about a stuffy nose or runny nose i do feel a bit more stuffy like today but there is no like runny nose or anything like that but i do feel a bit more pressure and stuffiness in my face today ok ok how about changes in smell or taste yeah i think just last night dinner it was just kind of a funky

have noticed in your limbs no no ok any issues with your bowel movements or urine no nothing ok how about nausea or vomiting no no nausea or vomiting ok and those were all the questions i had about your symptoms are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions yeah i have a couple conditions that i see my family doctor for i do have diabetes then i have high cholesterol i also have this thing called fatty liver but that is that is about it and a high blood pressure ok when were you diagnosed with all of these things yeah probably like it all kind of went down in my 40s i did gain a lot of weight at some point during my 40s and that is when all these things started happening ok so you said diabetes high blood pressure fatty liver and sorry what was the other one high cholesterol high cholesterol ok are you on medications for all of these things yeah so i am on a statin medication for the cholesterol then i am on metformin and then i am on a blood pressure medication as well i can not recall the name so yeah those are the medications that i am on ok and do you take your medications regularly as prescribed yeah i do not miss any doses ok good and are you up to date with all your immunizations yeah i think so ok good do you have any allergies no no allergies how about family history of lung conditions or heart conditions yes i have a pretty significant family history for heart conditions my father passed away from a heart attack in his 50s my mom has high blood pressure diabetes is also pretty big in my family as well ok well i am sorry to hear that any cancers in the family no no cancers ok do you smoke i used to when i was in my 30s i quit a pretty long time ago ok how much did you smoke before that i probably smoked up until i was 35 so for probably like 10 years from 25 to 35 and probably smoked a pack a day at that time ok yeah and do you drink alcohol i have been told like not to for my liver but i sometimes maybe have the rare red wine maybe once a month once a month ok any other recreational drugs no no recreational drugs ok no recreational drugs and where do you live right now i just live with my wife in an apartment in the city and yeah ok any old carpet dust mold anything that is concerning from that standpoint nope no and have you been in contact with anyone who has been sick recently not that i know of do you still go to work i just have like a desk job i have my own room it is not like i do not see too many people and like when i do i am wearing a mask so i do not think so ok i have stopped going to work though like just in case ok good and have you traveled to anywhere recently no we have been pretty homebound pretty homebound ok alright well that is good and those are all the questions that i had for you did you have any questions for myself yeah i do not know what do you think is causing all of this yeah it sounds like you have some sort of infection so the 1st thing we need to rule out is covid of course so we will do a swab and those swabs should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours and until then it is important that you do isolate and you isolate for 14 days at least and that includes from other people at home and if those swabs come back negative you could possibly have like another infection but if your symptoms worsen like you start getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures or anything like that you should come back to the er and we will get that checked out and so that is where we will start for now because your presentation is acute we think it is likely infection related ok that sounds good to me and should i be staying in my own room or anything like that at home yeah if you can like it is recommended that you try to isolate in your own room for the next 14 days because your symptoms do overlap with that of covid yeah ok sounds good thank you yeah no worries take care thank you",
