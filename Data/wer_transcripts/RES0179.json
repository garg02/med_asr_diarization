So that is quite high on my differential right now just because of your age, your smoking history and just the way you're presenting. So we're gonna do a couple of things. We're going to do a Covid swab just to rule that out. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but we will do investigations for lung cancer, so we'll start by doing a chest x-ray just to look for a mass or effusions and then from there if we think there are signs of cancer, we can do a CT. Umm, as well we can like stage with the Pet CT after we take a biopsy and send it off for pathology and that should give us more answers as to if you have cancer and if you do have cancer, what type of cancer so that we can talk about treatment plans and kind of what the prognosis is with those particular types of cancers? How does that sound?\n\nP: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you so much.\n\nD: OK yeah, no problem.\n\n",

and just the way you are presenting so we are going to do a couple of things we are going to do a covid swab just to rule that out you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours but we will do investigations for lung cancer so we will start by doing a chest x ray just to look for a mass or effusions and then from there if we think there are signs of cancer we can do a ct umm as well we can like stage with the pet ct after we take a biopsy and send it off for pathology and that should give us more answers as to if you have cancer and if you do have cancer what type of cancer so that we can talk about treatment plans and kind of what the prognosis is with those particular types of cancers how does that sound yeah that sounds great thank you so much ok yeah no problem",
