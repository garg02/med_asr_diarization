When I take a deep breath that the pain is a lot worse.\n\nD: OK, OK um. And when you do get that, get that pain. How long does it last? \n\nP: Um I would say, uh. Around 15-20 minutes. It's it goes away over overtime.\n\nD: OK, and the shortness of breath do you have that at rest as well?\n\nP: Uh no if I if I take a break or sit down to rest then I can usually catch my breath.

Any trauma to the chest area? Anything like that?\n\nP: Uh, No, no one else has been sick.

I know it was, I I didn't bring it up before 'cause it's just a day procedure, but I was definitely\nspending a lot more time um relaxing at home after that, a few weeks ago. \n\nD: OK, OK, so you haven't been moving around as much. I guess since the hysterectomy?\n\nP: yeah exactly it's starting to it was starting to get, the pain was starting to improve but it was keeping me on the couch a lot of days. \n\nD: OK, yeah. Um, are you on any medications?\n\nP: Um no I try, I've tried some Tylenol and Advil for the pain throughout this week, and it didn't really help much. But other than that, don't take any any medications, nothing for blood pressure or anything like that. \n\nD: OK, and sorry. What was the hysterectomy for?\n\nP: Um I I was having a lot of bleeding.\n\nD: OK, so were they thinking it was like a cancer or something?\n\nP: Um I think it was um.

And. Any history of family history of something called pulmonary embolism or DVTS.\n\nP: Uh, no, I haven't heard of a heard of pulmonary embolism before. \n\nD: OK, so it's basically blood clots in your lung. And then DVT's are deep vein thrombosis. So also blood clots but in different parts of your body.\n\nP: OK. \n\nD: Yeah, anything like that that you know of?\n\nP: Uh no, I I have might have heard of something like that happening in my mom actually, it might have been related to her heart attack, but I'm not specifically sure. \n\nD: OK, sure. Um an then do you smoke?\n\nP: Um I I smoke, I may be about half a pack of cigarettes per day. I've smoked ever since I was a teenager. I've tried to quit multiple times I I was smoking about a pack per day before, so I have\ncut it down, but still something that I'm working on. \n\nD: OK good, I'm glad you're trying to cut down. Um, we have resources available if you're interested\nin some more help. And you smoke um marijuana?\n\nP: No, I don't.\n\nD: OK. Any use of other recreational drugs?\n\nP: No, no.\n\nD: OK.

Did you have anything that you wanted to add? Anything that I hadn't touched on?\n\nP: Um No, I think you covered everything. Thank you. \n\nD: OK yeah, no worries. So I guess at this point we would do a physical exam. Just take a listen to your lungs and your chest. After that, so right now it sounds like it could be something vascular you know, like a pulmonary embolism like we talked about. That's kind of high on my list of things to\nwork up for. But also, we don't want to miss other things you know, like\ncancer, infection, autoimmune things that could affect your lungs, so we'll just do a\nwork up for all of that. How does that sound?\n\nP: Yeah, whatever, whatever you think we need to do. \n\nD: OK sounds good. Thank you for your time.\n\nP: Yeah, thanks.\n\n",
